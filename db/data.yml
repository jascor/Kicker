    - The Captain Hangs Up His Cleats

    - Derek Jeter was selected to the All-Star team 14 times. He has won five Gold

    - Five Inch Screens
    - Why phones keep getting bigger
    - Apple recently made headlines after selling four million phones in just one
      day, smashing their own previously-held record. In response to years of pressure
      from consumers and competitors alike, Apple announced two new phones in early
      September, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6+. Despite the lack of innovative features,
      a simple increase in the size of their line of flagship phones has allowed Apple
      to complete this impressive feat. The two phones showed a new path from one
      of the most famous technology companies in the world by considerably increasing
      the screen sizes of the phones.

      Apple, considering just how many companies have beaten them to the punch. The
      first smartphone that proved a larger screen could lead to success was Motorola's
      Droid X in 2010. The Droid was the second highest selling phone of 2010, behind
      only the iPhone 4, while also having a then massive 4.3" display. Money talks,
      and the phone showed how effective a larger screen could be. Soon after, many
      other companies followed, resulting in an explosion in the market of big screen
      phones in 2011.</p><p>This expansion has grown exponentially since then, with
      phone screens now eclipsing 6 inches. This growth has been brought on by an
      overall positive reaction to larger screens. This is shown especially in foreign
      markets such as China, where over 20 percent of smartphones are over 5 inches
      in height. According to a report by Canalys, a market research and analysis
      firm, just this year, from Quarter One to Quarter Two, the market share for
      large screened phones has grown by 17% worldwide, showing the demand for larger
      phones is still increasing.</p><p>William Mclendon, a Psychology teacher at
      Franklin, explained why our society prefers these bigger screens. "People have
      been conditioned to like the idea of bigger is better." Mclendon's view of society's
      reaction to larger screens is interesting considering he was one of the first
      adopters of the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Apple, one of the largest technology companies
      in the world, responded to this idea by increasing the size of their flagship
      phone while also adding a new line of phones - the iPhone Six Plus. The Six
      Plus has a screen size of 5.5", .8 inches bigger than the iPhone 6, which also
      received a boost in size of .7 inches from the iPhone 5. This change shows a
      change in approach from Apple, whose anti-size approach has dominated markets
      for years.</p><p>As companies continue the arms race of who can hit the "sweet
      spot," it is equally important that companies do not overshoot and increase
      the screen size to a point where people feel uncomfortable using it. This is
      one of the biggest fears surrounding the Six Plus, as some early adopters have
      reported that the screen is simply too big, making the entire experience uncomfortable.
      Although the 6 Plus has received a cold reception in some instances, companies
      are still confident that the way to the consumer's heart is through the mentality
      of bigger is better. One thing is for sure though, as phones get larger and
      larger, the way we use mobile technology is continuing to change.</p>

      when you hear shouting. Soon, youresurrounded by a SWAT, convinced youre an

      of times.

    - Sushi Ichiban lives up to its name
    - Ichiban means "number one"
    - Sushi Ichiban is a Japanese restaurant featuring a whimsical toy train which

      train selection includes maki, nigiri, salads, and desserts such as raspberry

      sushi bar. I have been here before, closer to dinner time during the weekday,
      and had to wait around ten minutes for a spot. Although the restaurant gets

    - Radical Feminism
    - Is radical feminism working against itself?
    - We live in a technology oriented society, constantly checking our social media
      and digital information. Social media allows individuals to communicate with
      each other digitally, even if they have never met. Interest boards dominate
      many regions of the internet, collecting high traffic and inadvertently creating
      thousands of subcultures. One of the more prominent subcultures perpetuated
      by the internet are radical feminists - individuals who believe our society’s
      power revolves around patriarchy, a male dominated system.<!--EndFragment-->

    - "<p>\n        \tThousands of Portlanders flooded Waterfront Park on Sunday,
      Sept. 21, in solidarity with the People's Climate March in NYC that drew hundreds
      of thousands of protesters. Portland's event was one of thousands of marches
      around the world that aimed to push political leaders into action to stop global
      warming.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe Portland event convened in
      \"The Bowl\" just south of the Hawthorne bridge downtown at 3:00 PM. Organizers
      paid Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for a permit to gather and march in the
      park. Several speakers addressed the crowd before the march began.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t\"Real climate action is the reason we are marching here
      this afternoon,\" an organizer told the Portland crowd. \"We want the United
      Nations, federal, and local governments to put policies in place that tackle
      climate change, but we can all do more in our lives too.\" Speakers included
      Gov. John Kitzhaber, John Wasiutynski, from the Multnomah County Office of Sustainability,
      Native American elder Gloria Brooks, and other local climate activists. Kitzhaber
      said, \"This is not a choice between the environment and the economy. It is
      a simple statement that the environment is not a resource to be exploited.\"\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \t<blockquote class='article_inline_quote
      full'>\n<p>This is not a choice between the environment and the economy. It

      \       \t<strongr></strongr>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tMany have
      criticized Kitzhaber for not doing enough to stop fossil fuel exports out of
      Oregon. There was booing, and chants of \"Coal, oil, gas, none shall pass!\"
      amidst the applause at the end of his speech.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tAfter
      the speakers were finished, the crowd marched north along the waterfront to
      the Saturday Market, where it deviated from the legal route into the street
      on SW Naito Parkway. A group of bicyclists organized by PDX Bike Swarm, bearing
      a banner reading \"END THE AGE OF COAL,\" blocked traffic to allow protesters
      to safely take over the street.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tFelix
      Lilly, a junior at Benson High School, attended the march, and thought it was
      a good-sized gathering. He said, \"I do think it was a good turnout. I definitely
      think enough people showed up … and our voice got heard.\" Lilly believes that
      with so many people marching around the world, leaders will be pressured into
      action.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t\"I would definitely hope that
      the politicians do something about it, so that generations down the road … that
      they can enjoy the world too.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe marches
      were scheduled prior to the United Nations Climate Summit that drew political
      leaders from around the world to NYC on Sept. 23, including President Barack
      Obama. Leaders at the summit were impressed by the showing at the New York march,
      and around the world, and there are plans to have a universal climate agreement
      signed by Dec. 2015 at the UN Conference in Paris.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tLeaders will have to act fast if they want to prevent the Earth's
      ecosystems from spiraling into chaos. Some scientists have set a threshold of
      2°C as a maximum \"safe\" amount of global warming, but the Earth has already
      warmed 0.85°C since pre-industrial times and is on track to warm much more than
      two degrees. Even two degrees of warming could cause irreversible damage.\n

    - "<p>\n        \tThousands of Portlanders flooded Waterfront Park on Sunday,
      Sept. 21, in solidarity with the People's Climate March in NYC that drew hundreds
      of thousands of protesters. Portland's event was one of thousands of marches
      around the world that aimed to push political leaders into action to stop global
      warming.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe Portland event convened in
      \"The Bowl\" just south of the Hawthorne bridge downtown at 3:00 PM. Organizers
      paid Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for a permit to gather and march in the
      park. Several speakers addressed the crowd before the march began.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t\"Real climate action is the reason we are marching here
      this afternoon,\" an organizer told the Portland crowd. \"We want the United
      Nations, federal, and local governments to put policies in place that tackle
      climate change, but we can all do more in our lives too.\" Speakers included
      Gov. John Kitzhaber, John Wasiutynski, from the Multnomah County Office of Sustainability,
      Native American elder Gloria Brooks, and other local climate activists. Kitzhaber
      said, \"This is not a choice between the environment and the economy. It is
      a simple statement that the environment is not a resource to be exploited.\"\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \t<blockquote class='article_inline_quote

      \       \t<strongr></strongr>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tMany have
      criticized Kitzhaber for not doing enough to stop fossil fuel exports out of
      Oregon. There was booing, and chants of \"Coal, oil, gas, none shall pass!\"
      amidst the applause at the end of his speech.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tAfter
      the speakers were finished, the crowd marched north along the waterfront to
      the Saturday Market, where it deviated from the legal route into the street
      on SW Naito Parkway. A group of bicyclists organized by PDX Bike Swarm, bearing
      a banner reading \"END THE AGE OF COAL,\" blocked traffic to allow protesters
      to safely take over the street.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tFelix
      Lilly, a junior at Benson High School, attended the march, and thought it was
      a good-sized gathering. He said, \"I do think it was a good turnout. I definitely
      think enough people showed up … and our voice got heard.\" Lilly believes that
      with so many people marching around the world, leaders will be pressured into
      action.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t\"I would definitely hope that
      the politicians do something about it, so that generations down the road … that
      they can enjoy the world too.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe marches
      were scheduled prior to the United Nations Climate Summit that drew political
      leaders from around the world to NYC on Sept. 23, including President Barack
      Obama. Leaders at the summit were impressed by the showing at the New York march,
      and around the world, and there are plans to have a universal climate agreement
      signed by Dec. 2015 at the UN Conference in Paris.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tLeaders will have to act fast if they want to prevent the Earth's
      ecosystems from spiraling into chaos. Some scientists have set a threshold of
      2°C as a maximum \"safe\" amount of global warming, but the Earth has already
      warmed 0.85°C since pre-industrial times and is on track to warm much more than
      two degrees. Even two degrees of warming could cause irreversible damage.\n

    - Diavolo Performance Review
    - A play by White Bird
    - In 1997 Walter Jaffe and Paul King started a nonprofit organization devoted
      to bringing gifted groups of dancers to Portland. They named it White Bird,
      after their 25 year old cockatoo Barney. For the past 17 years White Bird has
      dedicated themselves to the "excellence of dance." The organization has brought
      203 dance companies to Portland, and works closely with public schools to reach
      around 5,000 students each year.

      found the lack of storyline to be disengaging. "I had hoped they could make

    - The two largest cable companies in America want to become one.
    - Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable companies operating in
      the United States, want to merge, and that's a big problem.
    - |-
      <p>Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable companies operating in the United States, want to merge, and that's a big problem.</p><p>On February 13, 2014, Comcast revealed its plans to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) in a deal worth about $45 billion. The deal would see the two companies combine, furthering the gap between Comcast and America's third largest cable company, Charter Communications.</p><p>Using statistics from Google Analytics, the WebpageFX blog was able to construct a map of all 50 states showing the top internet service provider (ISP) in each state. The map showed that Comcast led the market in 18 states, including Texas and California, while TWC led in eight. If the merger clears regulatory review from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Comcast would be the leading ISP in 26 states, more than half of America.</p><p>According to data released by Leichtman Research Group, a company specializing in “research and analysis on broadband, media and entertainment industries," Comcast and TWC accounted for over 65 percent of all cable customers at the end of 2013, and over 38 percent of the entire broadband market in the United States. That's nearly twice as much as the third biggest American telecoms company, AT&amp;T. Comcast is so large that, in an effort to please regulators, they created a spin-off cable company, GreatLand Connections, and transferred 2.5 million of their customers over. Immediately, it became America's fifth largest ISP.</p><p>A Comcast and TWC merger would create an internet and cable television monopoly here in America, more so than Comcast's already large grasp on the broadband market. A monopoly in this space is the last thing American consumers need. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler revealed last month that about 80 percent of all Americans could only buy 25Mbps or better internet from a single provider. As the speed doubles to 50Mbps, the choice and availability is even more limited. Comcast holds partial blame for this severe lack of competition in most areas. In order to roll out its network to all customers in a city or region, local governments sign franchise agreements with Comcast that restrict the ability of other ISPs to come in and build infrastructure. Thus, it's difficult, especially for small start-ups, to innovate and create choice.</p><p>“At 25Mbps, there is simply no competitive choice for most Americans," Wheeler said in a speech at 1776. “Stop and let that sink in... three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice for the essential infrastructure for 21st century economics and democracy."</p><p>Not only do Americans have little choice in the broadband market, the speeds available to them are also subpar. According to the latest Broadband Progress Report released by the FCC, about 19 million, or over 16 percent of the American population, live in areas without any access to internet. Giant corporations such as Comcast make billions every year, yet they refuse to build infrastructure in rural and other areas without broadband service. Comcast buying out the competition would lessen their incentives to continue rollout in new areas.</p><p>While living in Baltimore, Rob Jamieson, a computer coding teacher at Franklin, felt the effects of severely limited options in broadband when Verizon FiOS was not available to him due to wiring issues.</p><p><blockquote class='article_inline_quote left'>

    - Civil Rights Investigation in Ferguson Continues
    - ''
    - On September 4 in Ferguson Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder announced
      that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would be launching a civil rights investigation
      into the Ferguson police department following the shooting of 18 year-old resident
      Michael Brown.
    - <p>On September 4 in Ferguson Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder announced
      that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would be launching a civil rights investigation
      into the Ferguson police department following the shooting of 18 year-old resident
      Michael Brown.</p><p>Ferguson activists, community leaders, as well as the police
      department of St. Louis County are welcoming a civil rights investigation to
      see if there was any racial profiling that led Officer Darren Wilson to shoot
      Michael Brown, which caused the Ferguson protests. Federal officials also said
      that they would be looking into police departments like other than Ferguson's,
      such as the St. Louis police department. The investigation is very important
      as it could lead to a federal takeover of the police. Michael Brown's shooting
      also sparked anger among African-American citizens, as dozens were arrested
      for looting. Tense interaction between protesters and law enforcement is still
      continuing, according to law enforcement of Ferguson and local media.</p><p>Officer
      Trevor Tyler from the Portland Police Bureau was informative about how officers
      train for crowd control in protests and other policing events. Tyler said, "When
      we train, we train to use the amount of force that is required to meet a situation."</p><p>Others
      also had a lot to say about Ferguson. Officer Schellman Brian, of the St. Louis
      police department, said new practices were being implemented into his police
      department. "Our chiefs of police, John Belmar, reached out to the Department
      of Justice to conduct for better practices." John Belmar is currently taking
      action to form new and improved practices.</p><p>The leader of the FHS Black
      Student Union, Ahmed Gedi, 12, gave his perspective on how he felt about the
      shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. "Really it's a common case
      of police brutality in the United States. I don't think we should be looking

      one month of investigating, there are still no charges or Police Department
      conduct violations reported yet. However, Gedi still has hopes for justice in

      whole greater issue in the United States, how your race effects how you're treated

    - <p>On September 4 in Ferguson Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder announced
      that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would be launching a civil rights investigation
      into the Ferguson police department following the shooting of 18 year-old resident
      Michael Brown.</p><p>Ferguson activists, community leaders, as well as the police
      department of St. Louis County are welcoming a civil rights investigation to
      see if there was any racial profiling that led Officer Darren Wilson to shoot
      Michael Brown, which caused the Ferguson protests. Federal officials also said
      that they would be looking into police departments like other than Ferguson's,
      such as the St. Louis police department. The investigation is very important
      as it could lead to a federal takeover of the police. Michael Brown's shooting
      also sparked anger among African-American citizens, as dozens were arrested
      for looting. Tense interaction between protesters and law enforcement is still
      continuing, according to law enforcement of Ferguson and local media.</p><p>Officer
      Trevor Tyler from the Portland Police Bureau was informative about how officers
      train for crowd control in protests and other policing events. Tyler said, "When
      we train, we train to use the amount of force that is required to meet a situation."</p><p>Others
      also had a lot to say about Ferguson. Officer Schellman Brian, of the St. Louis
      police department, said new practices were being implemented into his police
      department. "Our chiefs of police, John Belmar, reached out to the Department
      of Justice to conduct for better practices." John Belmar is currently taking
      action to form new and improved practices.</p><p>The leader of the FHS Black
      Student Union, Ahmed Gedi, 12, gave his perspective on how he felt about the
      shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. "Really it's a common case
      of police brutality in the United States. I don't think we should be looking
      for reasons to try to incite more police violence where as we can quell it somehow…"</p><p>After
      one month of investigating, there are still no charges or Police Department
      conduct violations reported yet. However, Gedi still has hopes for justice in
      Ferguson. "My hopes in Ferguson is that it draws attention nationally to the
      whole greater issue in the United States, how your race effects how you're treated
      by law enforcement…"</p>

      level. Quinn Nottage, Claire Stuhr and Fletcher Hazlehurst were all Franklin
      athletes that now play incollege.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tQuinn Nottage, class of 2014,
      played varsity soccer and basketball for four years at Franklin, and became
      a very influential player on the soccer field. Nottage was Franklin's number
      one goalie since his Freshmen year in 2010. At Franklin, he was inductedinto
      the FHS Hall of Fame for soccer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, Nottage attends Willamette
      University in Salem and is goalie for the reserve team. “The jump from high
      school soccer to college soccer is incredible!\" Nottage said,“Everybody is
      good, and every time I step onto the field I have to be ready to give 100% and
      compete every play no matter what.\" He hopes to keep improving and work his
      way up the ladder to be the best goalie at Willamette.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tClaire
      Stuhr was also in the class of 2014, and now is on the swim team at the University
      of Redlands. In high school, Claire swam club as well as with the Franklin team.
      She attended multiple state swim meets and was one of Franklin's top swimmers.
      However, she often felt like she put too much pressure on herself, which stunted
      her performance. “Of course I want to swim well in college, but I am going to
      focus on having fun first,\" Stuhr says.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the season hasn't
      started yet, Claire has started informal practices with some of her teammates.
      The coach leaves workouts on his door for them, and she has enjoyed swimming
      with and doing bonding activities with her new team.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFletcher
      Hazlehurst, class of 2012, played soccer for 2 years at Franklin, and ran track
      and Cross Country for 3. At Franklin, Fletcher placed 3rd, and 4th in the 1500m
      and 3000m respectively at the 2010 state track championships. Fletcher now attends
      the University of Vermont as a junior. He runs track and cross country there
      and is excited to see where this season will take his team. “The work ethic
      and tradition of excellence on the Franklin cross country team made it an easy
      transition,\" Hazlehurst says while reflecting on his high school experience.“
      My coaches at Franklin, Jacob Michaels and Jim Hennessey, were the best I could
      have asked for and I felt incredibly comfortable transitioning from their training
      to my current workouts. For that, I cannot thank them enough.\"\n</p>"

    - Book Review
    - God is Disappointed in You is a contemporary comedic summary of the Bible written
      by Mark Russell with cartoons by Shannon Wheeler. The book was published by
      Top Shelf Productions in August 2013, and quickly reached the top 25 and received
      positive reviews. Russell described the book as "a modern retelling of the bible,
      I like to explain it as the bible explained to somebody at a bar."

      decided on the subject because he grew up with the Bible and it's a "very important
      part of American cultural literacy; a lot of political decisions are made based
      on the Bible, people live their lives according to the Bible (or so they think)
      and yet nobody really seems to know anything about it. So it has this unique
      place in the zeitgeist of America that no other book does."</p><p>Russell was
      raised as a Born Again Christian "I was taught the belief that it was prophetic
      to things that were happening in these times and that our job on this planet
      is to fulfil the mission set forth by the Book of Revelations. Which is absolutely
      the most dangerous thing that a Christian or religious person can believe by
      the way." Russell said, "People were not living their lives to God's word as
      they understood it, they were creating God's word around their lives and giving
      it this underpinning of divinity it really didn't want." He believes there are
      a lot of misinterpretations about the Bible and one of the goals of his book
      is to clear up these misinterpretations.</p><p>On the process of making a book,
      Russell said "It all started with research." He studied the passages of The
      Bible over three years while also working a 9 to 5 job. Then he used his notes
      to write the "meat of the book" before adding humor and dialogue. Once written,
      Mark handed the book off to Wheeler to do the cartoons. With a book like this,
      one runs the risk of offending people. Nuns and pastors have bought the book
      and used it in sermons, whereas an atheist got offended at Russell for "drawing
      attention to The Bible". Russell said " Reverence is kind of the enemy of truth,
      and the more you're like 'oh I don't want to say this' you stop telling the
      truth at that point. You stop taking the book on its own merit and you're just
      trying to tiptoe around what you think people want to hear."</p>

    - White House Fence Jumper
    - What you should know
    - On Friday, September 19, a man named Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, was stopped by the
      Secret Service after jumping the White House fence. President Barack Obama had
      already left the House to Camp David to spend the weekend with his family.

      the Secret Service after jumping the White House fence. President Barack Obama
      had already left the House to Camp David to spend the weekend with his family.</p><p>After
      leaping over the fence, Gonzalez was detained for trespassing and ignoring orders
      to stop progressing into the White House. Gonzalez is a U.S army veteran who
      suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A federal charge would put Gonzalez
      in prison for 10 years. Gonzalez was also arrested back in July in rural Virginia,
      armed with an illegal firearm and carrying a map of Washington D.C, but he was
      released from jail on a $5,000 bond.</p><p>Two Franklin campus security personnel
      had thoughts to offer regarding this event, one giving his perspective on white
      house security. Domingo Urrutia said that white house security was lacking and
      it is a political issue now in the United States. Adam Shaw a member of FHS
      campus security, discussed on what he is instructed to do on a school campus
      to keep everyone safe.</p><p>"Basically we help the student movement to make
      sure people are where they''re supposed to be when they''re supposed to be there,"
      Shaw said. Shaw also explained details of a lockdown situation. "That can be
      a number of things, we could receive a call from someone in the neighborhood
      that there''s something strange going on outside. There are different types
      of lockdowns; there''s a lockdown when we shutdown the entire school and no
      one moves and we also have a lockdown called a team response when we have a
      student acting out in the classroom, so we''ll lock the school down."</p><p>After
      Gonzalez invaded the White House, the secret service''s director, Julia Pierson,
      stepped down over the scandal, in which she allowed President Barack Obama to
      be in an elevator with an armed man. This will possibly bring in a change of
      leadership, just as Urrutia wants: "They need a change of leadership within
      the Secret Service." Gonzalez is still in custody as of today. A federal judge
      in the District of Columbia ordered additional mental testing on Gonzalez, who
      has pleaded not guilty and is due back in court on October 21.</p>'

      More information <a href=''http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/franklin/files/I-pad_flyer102914_(english).pdf''>here</a>.</strong><strongr></strongr></p><p>Many
      Franklin students are curious toknow what happened to the iPads that were checked
      out to most freshmen last Januaryfor their second semester.</p><p>“They''re
      in afile cabinet, waiting," Franklin Media Specialist Sandra Childs said inSeptember.
      Childs was one of two coordinators of the Freshman First iPadProgram last year,
      back when she and math teacher Mary Jo Beeber had a teachingperiod dedicated
      to developing it. She is now the new FHS Librarian, and is notcertain if she
      will coordinate the iPad Program again this year.</p><p>        Last year, a
      $255,815 community grantfrom the Mount Hood Cable Regulatory Commission (MHCRC)
      was used to purchaseiPads which were then checked out to Franklin freshmen.
      Childs said that lastyear''s program was essentially a trial.</p><p>“There was
      asurvey done by kids – everybody reported everybody else was using them just
      toplay games, but then they listed all the things that they were doing … and
      Ithink they were useful. They increase motivation and engagement."</p><p>        She
      has proposed to the administrationthat they issue the iPads to the same students

    - '<p><strong>UPDATE: Franklin freshmen will be issued iPads later this year after
      undergoing "Digital Citizenship" training and turning in required fees and forms.
      More information <a href=''http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/franklin/files/I-pad_flyer102914_(english).pdf''>here</a>.</strong><strongr></strongr></p><p>Many
      Franklin students are curious toknow what happened to the iPads that were checked
      out to most freshmen last Januaryfor their second semester.</p><p>“They''re
      in afile cabinet, waiting," Franklin Media Specialist Sandra Childs said inSeptember.
      Childs was one of two coordinators of the Freshman First iPadProgram last year,
      back when she and math teacher Mary Jo Beeber had a teachingperiod dedicated
      to developing it. She is now the new FHS Librarian, and is notcertain if she
      will coordinate the iPad Program again this year.</p><p>        Last year, a
      $255,815 community grantfrom the Mount Hood Cable Regulatory Commission (MHCRC)
      was used to purchaseiPads which were then checked out to Franklin freshmen.
      Childs said that lastyear''s program was essentially a trial.</p><p>“There was
      asurvey done by kids – everybody reported everybody else was using them just
      toplay games, but then they listed all the things that they were doing … and
      Ithink they were useful. They increase motivation and engagement."</p><p>        She
      has proposed to the administrationthat they issue the iPads to the same students
      that used them last year, nowsophomores. The devices are currently locked up
      and sitting unused as Franklindetermines what new technology purchases will
      be made. The sophomores werealready trained and tested last year, Childs said,

    - What you should know
    - Every year students all over the English speaking world face a crisis as they
      prepare to graduate from their regional equivalent of a high school. Here in
      America, as well as in Australia, Canada, and most of the UK, university tuition
      has reached all-time highs. On top of that, tuition is still rising faster than
      ever before, while the need for a degree has never been greater, with graduates'
      yearly income ahead by tens of thousands of dollars.

      as he crept down the concrete stairs to his basement. He could hear his pigs
      crying in the dark.</p><p>"That, your Honor, was the inspiration for my work
      of art."</p><p>He reached for the light switch, and with satisfaction found

      innocence. They became pigs, manipulated by society. That's why I chose them."</p><p>He
      walked to the side of the pen. The five pigs that he had captured shrank back
      when they heard Jonathan approach, their empty eye sockets staring at his general
      location. The two that still had their tongues started screaming. He chuckled
      and turned away, leaning against the fence.</p><p>"Why did I remove their eyes?
      Your Honor, it was to show their blindness to the world around them. I also
      stripped them naked to show their vulnerability and shame…"</p><p>The pigs were

      pig dragged her body to the side of the pen closest to him, following his voice.
      She reached the fence and shot her hand out, grabbing the back of his shirt
      desperately. Jonathan spun around and jerked away from her weak grip.</p><p>"Now,
      now," he muttered calmly, rubbing the spot she had touched as if trying to clean
      it, "How boorish of you to interrupt me during my practice! You don't want to
      become pork chops like the last one, do you?"</p><p>"I'm starving," she moaned,
      "Please! I need something!"</p><p>"Oh, I see. Those things I put in your trough
      don't satisfy you after all," Jonathan mused. "Interesting! A bit of a shame
      that it took until now to realize that material possessions won't save you when
      you're being denied your basic needs."</p><p>"Please!" the pig whined.</p><p>"The
      items in the trough represent how the things humanity says are important, in
      the long run, are useless. A designer sweater cannot feed you. A new video game
      cannot provide you with shelter."</p><p>Jonathan stepped back from the pen,
      ignoring the pig's further cries.</p><p>"Removing their tongues? I did that
      one for my own personal pleasure, admittedly. I'm no saint, after all. You can
      interpret it however you wish."</p><p>Yesterday he had personally tipped off

      to the public.</p><p>"I assure you, Your Honor, I am perfectly sane. Probably
      more sane than anyone else here."</p><p>Jonathan grabbed a chunk of meat from
      the floor – the remains of the deceased sixth pig's left thigh – and tossed
      it into the pen. The screaming pig snatched it up and started eating it. The
      other pigs started fighting her for it.</p><p>Jonathan rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
      He could make that into a metaphor, too.</p><p>Overhead, in the house, he heard

    - "<p>\n\t\"Gold!\" Aster screeched. Arms flailing madly, she plunged her shovel
      into the soft soil. The buttery, <strongr></strongr>earthy scent filled her
      nostrils, overwhelmingly sweet and mouthwatering. Hearing her cry, Benjamin
      <strongr></strongr>trotted to her side, his ears swiveling and tongue flapping.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strongr></strongr>\"Now
      smell this, and tell me I'm right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBenjamin dropped his massive
      head close to the ground and began snuffling through the dirt. Abruptly, <strongr></strongr>he
      snapped upright and let out a long, melodious howl.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Eyyy, who's
      got a good nose? You do!\" Aster said, grabbing the dog's floppy face in her
      gloved hands and squishing it around. Benjamin snorted contentedly. He was a
      large dog, a mix of several hounds and some mastiff, with the size and long,
      thick coat of a grey wolf. He had lived out most of his days in the woods, and
      he smelled something nasty, a musty, pungent scent that clung to his fur like
      the water droplets that fell from the dense canopy above.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAster
      had busied herself with digging now, breaking through the top, rocky layer of
      soil using a shovel before abandoning the tool for the use of her hands. Soon,
      she was so heavily coated in mud and leaves that she resembled the very earth
      she was crouched upon, and it became impossible to tell girl from forest. She
      didn't mind it. After some time, Aster pulled from the earth a cluster of mud-encrusted
      mushrooms, of the highest quality. A wide smile spread across her dirt-spattered
      and densely freckled face. She sniffed. She sneezed, and let out a soft sigh.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a
      name=\"h.enu5qe42eivx\"></a>\"Making baaaank!\" Laughing, Aster gingerly placed
      the truffles into her knapsack, whistled for Benjamin, and, leaping over stumps
      and tree roots, made her way out of the shaded clearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.imjpk8lrrn2v\"></a>Pine
      and cedar branches gently brushed her face and moss clung to her shoes and soiled
      leggings. The only sounds were the soft squishing of her hiking boots on the
      overgrown path and Benjamin's heavy panting, with the occasional trilling of
      a distant bird. Aster breathed in deeply and inhaled the scent of the forest.
      So sharp, so heavy, so familiar. Rain began to fall, bringing with it another
      set of smells; decaying plant matter, waterlogged, ground-growing flowers, squirrels
      and mice shaking from the damp, well-worn wool socks gathering moisture. Aster
      much preferred the smells of the woods to the harsh chemicals of the city. Even
      as far from civilization as she was, her highly-developed sniffer could pick
      up the asphalt fumes from the nearest highway and she gagged, catching a whiff
      of cars and garbage on the breeze.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.ax2kzcf7r18j\"></a>Aster
      reached the edge of the woods and reluctantly pushed through the blackberry
      bushes that grew on the side of the road. She sniffed in disgust and pulled
      her scarf up to cover her nose and mouth. Moving swiftly, the small girl pulled
      her bicycle from beneath its hiding place, a large, drooping gooseberry bush.
      Benjamin bounded to her side and took his place in the large cart that she had
      fashioned to the back of the rusted vehicle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.gjdgxs\"></a>\"Time
      to go sell these things,\" she said, strapping on her helmet and oversized goggles.
      Maybe she would try the old hairy woman's farm today, it had been a long time
      since she'd tried peddling there. The ancient hag wasn't of the best temperament,
      but her eyes were poor and she would pay a good price for even the cruddiest
      of mushrooms. One kick and Aster was off, zipping down the water-slicked road.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a

      soil using a shovel before abandoning the tool for the use of her hands. Soon,
      she was so heavily coated in mud and leaves that she resembled the very earth
      she was crouched upon, and it became impossible to tell girl from forest. She
      didn't mind it. After some time, Aster pulled from the earth a cluster of mud-encrusted
      mushrooms, of the highest quality. A wide smile spread across her dirt-spattered
      and densely freckled face. She sniffed. She sneezed, and let out a soft sigh.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a
      name=\"h.enu5qe42eivx\"></a>\"Making baaaank!\" Laughing, Aster gingerly placed
      the truffles into her knapsack, whistled for Benjamin, and, leaping over stumps
      and tree roots, made her way out of the shaded clearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.imjpk8lrrn2v\"></a>Pine
      and cedar branches gently brushed her face and moss clung to her shoes and soiled
      leggings. The only sounds were the soft squishing of her hiking boots on the
      overgrown path and Benjamin's heavy panting, with the occasional trilling of
      a distant bird. Aster breathed in deeply and inhaled the scent of the forest.
      So sharp, so heavy, so familiar. Rain began to fall, bringing with it another
      set of smells; decaying plant matter, waterlogged, ground-growing flowers, squirrels
      and mice shaking from the damp, well-worn wool socks gathering moisture. Aster
      much preferred the smells of the woods to the harsh chemicals of the city. Even
      as far from civilization as she was, her highly-developed sniffer could pick
      up the asphalt fumes from the nearest highway and she gagged, catching a whiff
      of cars and garbage on the breeze.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.ax2kzcf7r18j\"></a>Aster
      reached the edge of the woods and reluctantly pushed through the blackberry
      bushes that grew on the side of the road. She sniffed in disgust and pulled
      her scarf up to cover her nose and mouth. Moving swiftly, the small girl pulled
      her bicycle from beneath its hiding place, a large, drooping gooseberry bush.
      Benjamin bounded to her side and took his place in the large cart that she had
      fashioned to the back of the rusted vehicle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.gjdgxs\"></a>\"Time
      to go sell these things,\" she said, strapping on her helmet and oversized goggles.
      Maybe she would try the old hairy woman's farm today, it had been a long time
      since she'd tried peddling there. The ancient hag wasn't of the best temperament,
      but her eyes were poor and she would pay a good price for even the cruddiest
      of mushrooms. One kick and Aster was off, zipping down the water-slicked road.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a

    - The Future of FHS Announcements
    - ''
    - For the remainder of the school year at Franklin High School, students and staff
      will no longer hear daily announcements over the intercom. Instead, teachers
      will read announcements aloud to students.
    - "<p>\n\tFor the remainder of the school year at Franklin High School, students

      teachers will read announcements aloud to students.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnnouncements
      at Franklin High School have traditionally been an everyday occurrence. From
      now on, students will be reading the announcements by their teachers during
      second period on A-days, and sixth period on B-days.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis decision
      was made by FHS staff members, Jill Register, Vice Principal's Secretary and
      Dennis Joule, Vice Principal. The change was made because announcements over
      the intercom often took 10 minutes. According to Joule, that would be too much
      wasted instruction time. Some teachers don't remember to read the announcements,
      but Joule hopes that they will read them. Joule also thinks the intercom only
      needs to be used for important announcements.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We need to use
      that voice phone system for something that's important to our school,\" said
      Joule. A teacher at Franklin High School, Desi Zak, likes the new system for
      announcements. \"I think it's a good system as long as the teachers remember,
      myself included,\" said Zak. \"I often times forget unless someone reminds me.\"
      Zak has mixed feelings about the announcements over the intercom. She does appreciate
      when announcements come on because she doesn't have to think about it, but sometimes
      they run long and have errors. She likes to read them herself, but the problem
      is remembering to read them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJoule has hopes for this new system.
      \"In a perfect world, every teacher would have this beautiful bulletin board
      to put up long standing announcements.\" Joule also has ideas for a more technical
      conclusion. \"We would also like to eventually move to a monitor system where
      we have screens in the building that display information,\" he said.\n</p>"

    - Nigerian Girls Abducted
    - ''
    - Over 200 Nigerian School girls were abducted by the Islamist group Boko Haram
      from their boarding school in April 2014. Since then, the Nigerian government
      has taken few steps, such as sending out armed militants and putting up roadblocks,
      to find the missing girls. Boko Haram has been bombing mosques and schools,
      and performing raids on entire villages since the initial attack.

    - 'The Consequences of Concussions '
    - ''
    - Recent events in both the World Cup and and in professional American football
      have led to the questioning of current concussion protocols. Players have been
      knocked out and sent stumbling to the ground, yet they've been allowed to continue
      playing through the rest of the game.
    - "<p>\n        \tRecent events in both the World Cup and and in professional
      American football have led to the questioning of current concussion protocols.
      Players have been knocked out and sent stumbling to the ground, yet they've
      been allowed to continue playing through the rest of the game.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tThis past summer, more than 4,000 former professional
      football players in the NFL have sued over the past few years because of brain
      damage. They're suffering from early onset dementia and Alzheimer's, which have
      a direct correlation to concussion related brain injuries. The price these players
      have to pay is small, considering they could have died from second impact syndrome.
      This is caused by two blows to the head in close succession. As more information
      comes in, doctors, players, and fans have been questioning whether the current
      protocols are enough.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tI believe there
      need to be more strict regulations on head injuries. Second impact syndrome
      is a constant threat, and previous NFL players are showing increased signs of
      early onset dementia, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is potentially one of the most dangerous risks of
      playing football. In 2013, about 4500 former NFL players sued the NFL for concussion-related
      injuries. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a
      study on 3,349 former NFL players, and found that the risk of neurodegenerative
      disease was three times higher than the average population. Additionally there
      has been an increased number of suicide and death rates in the NFL. Jovan Belcher,
      a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, fatally shot his girlfriend and then shot
      himself in the team parking lot in 2012. After doing a brain autopsy, they found
      evidence consistent with damage found in CTE sufferers. Other instances like
      this have surfaced as researchers are becoming more and more interested in their
      findings. No doctors have been able to confirm a direct cause, but additional
      evidence from autopsies and brain scans continues to suggest more detailed conclusions.\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tWhile watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup
      this summer, I saw Christoph Kramer get a serious blow to the head in the World
      Cup final. The doctors came running out and within about 40 seconds they deemed
      him able to play. Kramer fell down 15 minutes later and had to be helped off
      of the field. Reports from the referee surfaced after the game that Kramer asked
      him if he was really playing in the World Cup final. According to ww.nfl.com
      it takes between 8-12 minutes to examine a concussion. It also appears that
      Kramer made the decision on his own to keep playing. In a situation when the
      player is clearly dazed, the player shouldn't have a say in whether they get
      to come back on the field.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tTo see the
      lasting effect of one decision, look no further than Taylor Twellman, who played
      for the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer before suffering a career-ending
      concussion. Twellman suffered seven concussions between ages 10 and 28, and
      has started a charity called THINKTaylor to help raise awareness about concussions.
      Twellman's life was turned upside down after his last concussion, when he lost
      the ability to read a book or watch a whole movie. He didn't recover for years.
      \"You do not need a big impact to suffer a concussion, just like you don't have
      to be knocked out cold. And brave? My life has changed completely because 'I
      showed heart' and 'bravely' carried on playing,\" Twellman said in an article
      for the guardian.com.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOver this past summer,
      the English Premier League has instituted some changes to their concussion protocols.
      Now there must be a 'tunnel doctor' to assess the player's condition, and a
      new concussion recognition tool must be carried and used. Premier League Director
      of Football Mike Foster said to premierleague.com that, \"Premier League clubs
      have already addressed a number of recommendations by making changes to the
      Premier League Rule Book and we recognise that, with other stakeholders, we
      have a wider role to play in making all participants in the game aware of the
      signs of concussion and the importance of following the return to play guidelines.\"\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tDespite these new achievements, these are
      still very flawed rules. Who determines whether the doctors followed the concussion
      recognition tool provided? In addition, the 'tunnel doctors' are paid for by
      the team and not the league. Each team wants to make money and there is a chance
      that the doctors won't pull the best player from a match. The new protocol was
      tested on October 6, 2014 when Thibaut Courtois suffered a blow to the head
      and lost consciousness. The doctors assessed him for about a minute and then
      deemed him able to play. 15 minutes later, he sat down by the goal and could
      not continue. In this case, the new rules didn't actually change anything and
      were more just a way of pleasing concerned viewers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThe mere fact that the issues around concussions are now common knowledge
      is a great achievement, but recent incidents have proven that they still aren't
      enough. The world of professional sports needs to get their act together before
      anything gets worse.\n        </p>"

      been allowed to continue playing through the rest of the game.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tThis past summer, more than 4,000 former professional
      football players in the NFL have sued over the past few years because of brain
      damage. They're suffering from early onset dementia and Alzheimer's, which have
      a direct correlation to concussion related brain injuries. The price these players
      have to pay is small, considering they could have died from second impact syndrome.
      This is caused by two blows to the head in close succession. As more information
      comes in, doctors, players, and fans have been questioning whether the current
      protocols are enough.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tI believe there
      need to be more strict regulations on head injuries. Second impact syndrome
      is a constant threat, and previous NFL players are showing increased signs of
      early onset dementia, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is potentially one of the most dangerous risks of
      playing football. In 2013, about 4500 former NFL players sued the NFL for concussion-related
      injuries. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a
      study on 3,349 former NFL players, and found that the risk of neurodegenerative
      disease was three times higher than the average population. Additionally there
      has been an increased number of suicide and death rates in the NFL. Jovan Belcher,
      a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, fatally shot his girlfriend and then shot
      himself in the team parking lot in 2012. After doing a brain autopsy, they found
      evidence consistent with damage found in CTE sufferers. Other instances like
      this have surfaced as researchers are becoming more and more interested in their
      findings. No doctors have been able to confirm a direct cause, but additional
      evidence from autopsies and brain scans continues to suggest more detailed conclusions.\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tWhile watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup
      this summer, I saw Christoph Kramer get a serious blow to the head in the World
      Cup final. The doctors came running out and within about 40 seconds they deemed
      him able to play. Kramer fell down 15 minutes later and had to be helped off
      of the field. Reports from the referee surfaced after the game that Kramer asked
      him if he was really playing in the World Cup final. According to ww.nfl.com
      it takes between 8-12 minutes to examine a concussion. It also appears that
      Kramer made the decision on his own to keep playing. In a situation when the
      player is clearly dazed, the player shouldn't have a say in whether they get
      to come back on the field.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tTo see the
      lasting effect of one decision, look no further than Taylor Twellman, who played
      for the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer before suffering a career-ending
      concussion. Twellman suffered seven concussions between ages 10 and 28, and
      has started a charity called THINKTaylor to help raise awareness about concussions.
      Twellman's life was turned upside down after his last concussion, when he lost
      the ability to read a book or watch a whole movie. He didn't recover for years.
      \"You do not need a big impact to suffer a concussion, just like you don't have
      to be knocked out cold. And brave? My life has changed completely because 'I
      showed heart' and 'bravely' carried on playing,\" Twellman said in an article
      for the guardian.com.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOver this past summer,
      the English Premier League has instituted some changes to their concussion protocols.
      Now there must be a 'tunnel doctor' to assess the player's condition, and a
      new concussion recognition tool must be carried and used. Premier League Director
      of Football Mike Foster said to premierleague.com that, \"Premier League clubs
      have already addressed a number of recommendations by making changes to the
      Premier League Rule Book and we recognise that, with other stakeholders, we
      have a wider role to play in making all participants in the game aware of the
      signs of concussion and the importance of following the return to play guidelines.\"\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tDespite these new achievements, these are
      still very flawed rules. Who determines whether the doctors followed the concussion
      recognition tool provided? In addition, the 'tunnel doctors' are paid for by
      the team and not the league. Each team wants to make money and there is a chance
      that the doctors won't pull the best player from a match. The new protocol was
      tested on October 6, 2014 when Thibaut Courtois suffered a blow to the head
      and lost consciousness. The doctors assessed him for about a minute and then
      deemed him able to play. 15 minutes later, he sat down by the goal and could
      not continue. In this case, the new rules didn't actually change anything and
      were more just a way of pleasing concerned viewers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThe mere fact that the issues around concussions are now common knowledge
      is a great achievement, but recent incidents have proven that they still aren't
      enough. The world of professional sports needs to get their act together before
      anything gets worse.\n        </p>"

    - The Marysville Tragedy
    - ''
    - 'On October 24, many students in a high school in Marysville, Washington, were
      in the cafeteria having lunch. Suddenly, across the cafeteria, a gunshot rang
      out. Then several more. Students panicked and fled. Those still in class huddled
      under desks and locked the doors, waiting for the police to arrive. Students,
      teachers, and civilians alike were shocked to discover the identity of the shooter:
      Jaylen Fryburg, a popular and successful member of the local community. Also
      shocking is the identity of his five victims: three close friends and two cousins.
      He cared about all of them.'

      and Andrew Fryburg, occurred in the hospital. Nate Hatch, the shooter's cousin,
      was in intensive care but showed significant improvement and was released on

    - You ever been dead before? It sucks. It really does. It sucks even more when
      you've died at the ripe age of 18. Damn, I was just starting college with my
      boyfriend too, was planning on moving into the dorms with him and majoring in
      pre-med, a bit ironic don't you think so? A kid wanting to become a doctor ended
      up dying before he could even save others. It's not like I'm bitter about my
      death. It's been too long and the indignation has sort of faded away. But now,
      I'm simply a ghost, wandering around my old life and sometimes wishing I was
      alive again. In this moment though, I most definitely wish I was alive.

    - 'Yemeni Capital Overthrown '
    - ''
    - The Yemeni capital, Sanaa, was overthrown by the Houthis, a group belonging
      to the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam, on September 21, 2014. To show their authority,
      the Houthis took over the TV stations a couple days prior to overthrowing the
      capital. Mohammed Basindawa, the prime minister, was overthrown, and thousands
      have evacuated the nation due to civil unrest and potentially dangerous situations.

      this time and a Cleveland alumnus. \"The government and the Houthis were negotiating
      throughout the time they were encircling the city, and there were some days
      when it looked like the talks could go somewhere, and other times when more
      serious fighting looked likely.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMax evacuated on the morning
      of September 21, and even though he was never in a dangerous situation, he felt
      \"it wasn't worth being in that environment anymore.\" In the last few days
      he was in Yemen, he could hear gunshots and explosions coming from only a few
      kilometers away.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHorten's mother, Anette Horten, said, \"We were
      very anxious for Max's safety. He was in our minds constantly, and we sought
      out as much information as we could.\" She mentioned that it was hard trying
      to find a reliable source for information because the situation changed on a
      day-to-day basis. However, the connections Max built with people in Yemen were
      the reason it was so hard for him to leave.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMax said, \"Yemen
      is full of some very generous, kind, curious people.\" Some are in support of
      the Houthis control, while others are just frustrated with the political system
      in Yemen. \"My own view is that Yemen could still come out for the better from
      all of this, especially if the Houthis are sincere about their wish to institute
      a technocratic government and no more. But if it is all just a facade for another
      power grab by a different group, Yemeni cynicism about politics will harden
      and anything resembling democracy in Yemen will suffer a huge setback.\" In
      more simple words, Max\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, the Houthis still aren't backing
      down and no single political figure has taken charge. The constant bombings
      and shootings serve as evidence that no compromise has been reached.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"No
      one, not even the powerful groups in Yemen, knows how things will turn out in
      the coming months,\"said Anette Horten. She, and many others, hope that Yemen
      can find a way to avoid a civil war that would create a more impoverished society
      and that the different groups will be able to share control over the national
      government.\n</p>"

    - 'Gamergate is a social media movement that has become a conflict between feminists
      and people calling for journalistic ethics in the gaming industry that has erupted
      across the internet, especially on 4chan, Reddit, 8chan, and Twitter, using
      the hashtag #Gamergate. Many people who use the Gamergate hashtag say that the

      began in August when game developer Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend posted extensive
      blog posts alleging that she had slept with Nathan Grayson, a writer for video
      game blog Kotaku. The implication was that she had slept with Grayson and others
      during their relationship in order to receive better coverage of her game <em>Depression
      Quest</em>. Though Quinn and Grayson both denied having traded sex for game
      coverage, incensed gamers had already taken to social networks, protesting the
      apparent ethics breach, and setting the Gamergate movement in motion.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tQuinn and other women in the gaming industry began receiving
      threats from people associating themselves with Gamergate. Included in those
      attacked was Anita Sarkeesian of <em>Feminist Frequency</em>, a video webseries
      \"exploring the representations of women in pop culture narratives.\" Sarkeesian
      eventually became a prominent figure in opposition to Gamergate. She was invited
      to speak at Utah State University in October about the portrayal of women in
      video games, but had to cancel her presentation when the university received
      threats of a school shooting if she were allowed to speak. Utah state law prohibits
      colleges from restricting gun carriers with a concealed weapons permit, so her
      proposition to continue the lecture with tightened security was ruled out.\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tKieran Andrews (10), a self-described gamer,
      sees Gamergate as \"a loud minority of people in the gaming society that are
      afraid of change,\" and believes that as video games become popular among people
      of all races, ages, and genders, some men are afraid of the increasing involvement
      of women in video game culture.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tLeader
      of Franklin's League of Legends Club, Matthew Fairman (11), on the other hand,
      approved of Gamergate's original call for journalistic ethics.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t\"I feel that originally it wasn't about feminism, but
      now Anita Sarkeesian is using that as a shield to gather supporters behind her,\"
      Fairman said. \"It started as something [real], it blew up, and now it is just
      a mainstream headline: <em>male masses target poor females, feminist leader</em>.\"
      He thinks the media coverage of Gamergate does not show the whole picture, but
      rather that \"all the world is hearing about, all the mainstream media is hearing
      about, is the threats. They're not hearing about any of the arguments.\"\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tAt this point Fairman thinks Gamergate is simply giving
      gamers a bad name, and that they should back off from the movement. Andrews
      agrees, \"The word Gamergate is now tainted. You could write an entire speech
      about ethics in gaming journalism, and if you use the word Gamergate once, your
      entire speech gets thrown out the window. \"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tFor
      the most part, the Gamergate movement has lost its momentum. Statistics from
      Google show that web traffic related to Gamergate has died down considerably
      since it peaked in late October. The issue of misogyny in previously male-dominated
      industries, however, will surely continue to incite debate in the future.\n

    - Australia May Silence More Than Just Whistleblowers With New Legislation
    - ''
    - In an age where a new whistleblower seems to come to the attention of the media
      daily, we are in danger of becoming desensitized to the stories that these people
      convey, and instead treat them as just another tattle tale. The question stops
      becoming what the whistleblowers are reporting, and instead becomes what happens
      to them afterwards in the eyes of their government.

      question stops becoming what the whistleblowers are reporting, and instead becomes
      what happens to them afterwards in the eyes of their government.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis
      is exactly what Australia is attempting to focus on after new legislation was
      passed by the Australian Senate on September 25. These laws emphasize exactly
      what is supposed to happen to anyone who points a criticizing finger at the
      government. This umbrella usage of \"whistleblower\" includes everyone from
      those within the government who divulge secrets, to even well-meaning journalists.
      If something seems off with this, then you're heading in the right direction.
      This piece of legislature is written in such a way that any benefit these leaks
      may provide to the public becomes irrelevant. Individuals who release any government
      information, no matter the importance, will face prison sentences of at least
      five years.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis sentence is absolutely outrageous, considering
      that most of these people are simply attempting to do their jobs and make their
      country's government a more open process. This bill is just another in a long
      line of reactions by governments across the world aiming to protect themselves
      from the likes of Edward Snowden. It is remarkable that one man's actions have
      caused governments around the world to change how they deal with whistleblowers
      and minimize their effect. Australia is simply the most recent; the passage
      of this legislature came just days a few days after Freya Newman, a 21-year-old
      whistleblower, pleaded guilty to accessing private records at the Whitehouse
      School of Design in Sydney. Newman's suspicions of a scholarship being wrongly
      given to the Australian Prime Minister's daughter provoked her to illegally
      access private records. Her findings supported her but the public had little
      response, excluding the prosecution of Freya herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy allowing
      yet another government to go ahead with this campaign against whistleblowers
      we also encourage the silencing of possible informants. If fewer people are
      willing to speak up about their government, then there is a high possibility
      that the public will become dangerously uninformed. Countries have time and
      time again used brute force as an approach when it comes to dealing with whistleblowers,
      instead of the delicate touch that is necessary. Take Snowden for example: he
      immediately left the country and hopped from nation to nation, constantly staying
      away from America's reach until he settled in Russia, where he has lived for
      over 15 months. All the while he was not only accused of numerous crimes, which
      were not unfounded, but also was called things such as \"traitor\" and \"coward\"
      by everyone from Government officials to the media. If governments around the
      world wish to maintain any kind of charade of translucence through the government
      process, then it would behoove them to not seem so nasty when it comes to dealing
      with their accusers.\n</p>"

    - The Delish Thai Dish
    - A mouthwatering review
    - An authentic and delicious destination by the name of Thai Dish is located in
      the upper Hawthorne area on 46th avenue. It is worth walking a few extra blocks
      from the trendy main shopping area to get a taste of Thai Dish's cuisine. They
      serve a variety of Thai food, as evident in the name, from soups to desserts.
      The inside of this destination is noticeably clean with soft pop music playing
      in the background. Christmas lights and personal photos adorn the walls.

      my main dish, I ordered Pad Kee Mao with pork, also known as Spicy Basil Noodles
      or Drunken Noodles. It was served in a large portion with a twisted orange for
      garnish, which was a special touch. The noodles were thick and thankfully did
      not clump together like I have seen at other Thai restaurants. The flavor was
      a medley of soy sauce, sweet basil and subtle spiciness, with the small pieces
      of pork tasty and well cooked. Thai Dish is more than happy to adjust the spice
      level of certain entrees. Bean sprouts and broccoli added a crisp bite to contrast
      to the chewy noodles. The bell pepper was an interesting addition that added
      something unique to the flavor profile.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir Thai iced tea was
      traditionally refreshing; the sweet creaminess was balanced perfectly with the
      strong brewed tea. At Thai Dish I have also tried the yellow curry, Pad Thai,
      and Pad See Ew. The fried tofu is a great protein to choose for a dish; its
      soft texture soaks up flavors well and will be enjoyed by vegetarians and omnivores
      alike.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI always enjoy the consistency of the meals at Thai Dish
      and have yet to order something that was not made with care. It is a wonderful
      local business to support by stopping in for lunch, dinner or take out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\thttp://www.thaidishcuisine.com/\n</p>"

    - A Texas Sized Monopoly on Calculators

      scene here at Franklin, but the homogenized nature of our calculators imply
      something more sinister. If any other school supply was so standardized, students
      would be outraged. I personally know some students who would never be without
      their Dixon Ticonderogas, but some swear by a mechanical model. Why are calculators

      Instruments hold an often unnoticed pseudo-monopoly over our calculators. The
      Dallas-based corporation got its start manufacturing microchips and conductors
      in the 1930s, and calculators became a subdivision. Their \"Educational Technology\"
      only makes up 4% of their inventory, but for the 2013 revenue report, TI calculators
      raked in a whopping 2.6 billion dollars.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEven with the booming semiconductor business supporting this
      endeavor, calculators aren't cheap. A basic TI-83 costs around $120, and advanced
      models can reach up to almost $200. That's a huge cost barrier for something
      considered necessary for over half the math classes offered at Franklin High
      School.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tThe thing
      is, TI isn't a monopoly -- not even close. There are twice as many approved
      calculators for non-TI brands on the AP list, and many of these Casio and HP
      brands often cost a fraction of the price. The fact that these can offer the
      same functions for less is a serious cause for suspicion.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tWe've been fed the TI agenda through
      sheer familiarity. It's no fault of any administration; it's simply the culture
      that's arisen. Some math textbooks contain sections specifically devoted to
      using a TI calculator. Nearly every math class is stocked with 30 TI's, and
      the Franklin library lends over 250 calculators to students. These calculators
      were purchased in years previous with PTA grants, and their homogeneity is maintained.\n

      Clerk of the Franklin Library and manager of their calculator supply. \"If a

      I've got a lovely little TI-83 I picked up about two years ago. The problem
      is that TI, with their cultural advantage, may change calculator costs on arbitrary
      whims.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tStandardized
      tests like the ACT and the SAT claim to need no calculator, but the student
      with one saves time on basic computations, time that can lead to a better score.
      In the context of AP testing, some calculators, like the TI-89, can solve indefinite
      integrals and derivatives, automating a crucial step in calculus. Having a high-functioning
      calculator is a distinct advantage, but the high prices of TI models and their
      limited supply in schools serve as an economic barrier.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tIf you're low on funds, don't be afraid
      to try something outside the TI box (after a little research on your specific
      model, mind you). Encouraging diversity in calculators could create the competition
      necessary to shake TI off its throne, lowering their prices, and possibly encouraging
      innovation. Without the default cultural advantage, TI might need to find a
      way to improve their \"classic\" models with something more substantial than
      a change of color schematics.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tSo

      to try something outside the TI box (after a little research on your specific
      model, mind you). Encouraging diversity in calculators could create the competition
      necessary to shake TI off its throne, lowering their prices, and possibly encouraging
      innovation. Without the default cultural advantage, TI might need to find a
      way to improve their \"classic\" models with something more substantial than
      a change of color schematics.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tSo
      go ahead, try the other brands; the first thing you can calculate is the difference
      you'll make.\n                </p>"

    - 'Graffiti Becomes Art at Franklin '
    - 'A new way of expression '
    - Look around the Franklin Campus, and you will see colorful art done by the Franklin
      High School Art 3-4 students. This fall, the Art 3-4 teachers, Ms. Berning and
      Mr. Perez, decided to have their students beautify the campus. This was made
      possible thanks to Mr. Joule who gave them permission to draw on the building
      as long as the images were "appropriate and removable."

    - 'Smart Collective: A Music Home for All'
    - A review for a new and open venue
    - Smart Collective, a skate shop converted into an all age venue had its first
      show on Saturday November 1. Doors opened at 5 and the musical sensation Rarrey
      Manough played at 6, followed by New Social Outcasts, Panorama, and Mr.Bones.
      The show was an overall success; the bands played indie alternative rock. Franklin
      student and member of New Social Outcasts, Octavio Dowling, said that "The vibe
      was pretty chill." Admission is free, albeit a two dollar suggested donation
      makes Smart Collective even more accessible to the ostracized musical youth
      community as some other venues such as Crystal Ballroom can cost up to 15 dollars
      per event. Many other venues that did allow all ages and unsegregated communities
      have closed or are closing, such as Laughing Horse. Smart Collective gives a
      home to the lost hearts of those indie youths cast out from age restricted venues
      who so long for live musical fulfillment.

    - A New Era for Android
    - Bigger phones on the way
    - Google recently made one of the largest announcements of the year in their classic
      style. On October 15, there was no big convention, no large auditorium showcasing
      Google's achievements, not even an interview–simply a blog post. The post in
      question addressed Google's popular mobile operating system, Android, and what
      was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars of Google.
    - "<p>\n\tGoogle recently made one of the largest announcements of the year in
      their classic style. On October 15, there was no big convention, no large auditorium
      showcasing Google's achievements, not even an interview–simply a blog post.
      The post in question addressed Google's popular mobile operating system, Android,
      and what was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars
      of Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAndroid is so important that according to a report
      by comScore, an American company specializing in the collection of data, Android
      is used in over 50 percent of America's smartphones. When you look at the entire
      world, the numbers only become more staggering. A statement released by International
      Data Corporation says that 84.7 percent of the world's smartphones run Android,
      and the number continues to grow. Google plans to help this growth with a three-step
      process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Google is overhauling the look of Android by implementing
      a new visual language, which has been dubbed Material design. Material design
      has been an instant hit with many early adopters, and is a key aspect of the
      new iteration of Android, Android Lollipop. Another important part of Lollipop
      is simplicity, as Google's Vice President of Design Matias Duarte recently said
      in an interview with The Verge.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We want to find ways to do more,
      be smarter, but at the same time put less burden on the user.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond,
      Google is adding two new mobile devices that both run Lollipop, the Nexus 6
      and 9. These devices are manufactured by companies like Asus or Samsung, and
      then are sold by and serviced through Google. The Nexus 9, this year's tablet,
      features top of the line technical specs and stock Android. There are two big
      things that have pushed the Nexus 6, the new phone, into the news lately, one
      being the screen–which is a 5.96\" behemoth that many see as too big for their
      hands. The other is the price. The Nexus 6 starts at $650 unlocked (the same
      as the iPhone 6), a major change from the $350 precedent set by the Nexus 5,
      which was last year's model. Still, it is obvious why Google had to make the
      jump. When the Nexus 5 was released many had complaints. The battery wasn't
      strong enough, the camera wasn't good enough. Due to this Google set out to
      make an Android phone that had the best possible performance in every category,
      and the answer they came up with was the Nexus 6. Google executive Sandeep Waraich
      explained the price point in an interview with CNET. \"It was a deliberate decision
      to push the boundaries of technology. We first arrived at the solution, then
      the price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final stage of Google's plan that is the Android
      platform is the introduction of the Nexus Player, which integrates their TV-streaming
      service, Android TV. This is not Google's first attempt, the \"Chromecast\"
      is another device that streamed media from your Android device to your television.

      technological advancements of the 21st century so far.\n</p>"
    - "<p>\n\tGoogle recently made one of the largest announcements of the year in
      their classic style. On October 15, there was no big convention, no large auditorium
      showcasing Google's achievements, not even an interview–simply a blog post.
      The post in question addressed Google's popular mobile operating system, Android,
      and what was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars
      of Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAndroid is so important that according to a report
      by comScore, an American company specializing in the collection of data, Android
      is used in over 50 percent of America's smartphones. When you look at the entire
      world, the numbers only become more staggering. A statement released by International
      Data Corporation says that 84.7 percent of the world's smartphones run Android,
      and the number continues to grow. Google plans to help this growth with a three-step
      process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Google is overhauling the look of Android by implementing
      a new visual language, which has been dubbed Material design. Material design
      has been an instant hit with many early adopters, and is a key aspect of the
      new iteration of Android, Android Lollipop. Another important part of Lollipop
      is simplicity, as Google's Vice President of Design Matias Duarte recently said
      in an interview with The Verge.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We want to find ways to do more,
      be smarter, but at the same time put less burden on the user.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond,
      Google is adding two new mobile devices that both run Lollipop, the Nexus 6
      and 9. These devices are manufactured by companies like Asus or Samsung, and
      then are sold by and serviced through Google. The Nexus 9, this year's tablet,
      features top of the line technical specs and stock Android. There are two big
      things that have pushed the Nexus 6, the new phone, into the news lately, one
      being the screen–which is a 5.96\" behemoth that many see as too big for their
      hands. The other is the price. The Nexus 6 starts at $650 unlocked (the same
      as the iPhone 6), a major change from the $350 precedent set by the Nexus 5,
      which was last year's model. Still, it is obvious why Google had to make the
      jump. When the Nexus 5 was released many had complaints. The battery wasn't
      strong enough, the camera wasn't good enough. Due to this Google set out to
      make an Android phone that had the best possible performance in every category,
      and the answer they came up with was the Nexus 6. Google executive Sandeep Waraich
      explained the price point in an interview with CNET. \"It was a deliberate decision
      to push the boundaries of technology. We first arrived at the solution, then
      the price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final stage of Google's plan that is the Android
      platform is the introduction of the Nexus Player, which integrates their TV-streaming
      service, Android TV. This is not Google's first attempt, the \"Chromecast\"
      is another device that streamed media from your Android device to your television.
      On the other hand, the Nexus Player uses a remote, while also allowing devices
      to connect to the Player. Another big difference between the two devices is
      the price. The Chromecast was touted as a cheap alternative when it was released
      in 2013 at $35, while the Nexus Player comes in at $100.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn October
      15, Google changed how their Android operating system will grow and operate
      for the next few years, and this affects much of today's technology-oriented
      society. The most important part of this is how much consumers are willing to

    - Flying Lotus Concert
    - An electrifying way to create music
    - Portland entered a new dimension of stage presence on November 17th when Flying
      Lotus and his team brought their Audio/Visual spectacle to the Roseland Theater.
      Steven Ellison, otherwise known as Flying Lotus, has been a rising star in his
      craft. His critically acclaimed, multi-genre music has made a substantial mark
      in the music-production world. His unique sound combines Jazz, Hip-Hop, and
      R&amp;B to create Trip-hop. His tour, which has covered most of North America,
      follows his recent album release "You're Dead." The album features many big
      name artists such as MF Doom, Kendrick Lamar, and Snoop Dogg. It also features
      Ellison's good friend Thundercat, who is the opening act on the tour.

      crowd in a long lasting chant for an encore. After the show the crowd outside
      was blown away. People were raving to each other about their favorite visuals

    - There is not much rest for Will Reed-Dustin, a three sport Varsity athlete.
      He trains year-round to perform on the field, mat, and in school. As a lineman
      on the football team, he's achieved great defensive skills that he carries into
      wrestling. He was inspired to join the wrestling team after transferring to
      Franklin in his Sophomore year because of his three older brothers who also
      wrestle. The fact that it's an individual sport is both his favorite and least
      favorite aspect of it. As he put it, "If you win it's 100% on you, if you lose
      its 100% on you," which is also why he throws shot put, javelin, and discus
      for Franklin's Track &amp; Field team.

      celebrated his 100th birthday on November 10, his church outdating him by about
      20 years, having been founded in 1894 by Italian Catholic immigrants. Portland's
      'Little Italy' neighborhood, where Raschio grew up. has since been developed
      almost to the point of being unrecognizable, but Saint Michael the Archangel
      Catholic Parish serves as a reminder of the area's history.\n                </p>\n

      \               \tAfter attending grade school at St. Michael's, Raschio went
      to St. Stephen's High School in SE Portland, where he remembers playing baseball
      against Franklin. After high school, he enrolled in the pharmacy program at
      North Pacific College, but transferred to OSU a year later, switching into the
      PreMed program, and ultimately into teaching.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tIt was difficult to find work in the heart of the Great Depression,
      and Raschio applied for all kinds of jobs across the state before finally getting
      a letter granting him an interview for a teaching position in Gold Beach, OR.
      At the same time, he received a telegram offering him a job as a government
      clerk in Washington, D.C. The job in Gold Beach would have only paid $85 a month,
      while the job being handed to him in D.C. paid $100 a month, so Raschio traveled
      across the country to the capital. Two years later, in September 1941, a gathering
      was held in D.C. where the names of ten men were drawn for the ceremonial part
      of the army draft.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \t\"Guess
      who was one of the ten? Lucky me,\" Raschio jokes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tHe didn't want to be a footsoldier, so he requested a transfer
      to the navy and was able to start flight training on December 1, 1941. A week
      later the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, commencing the U.S.'s involvement in
      World War II, so Raschio went through his training and ended up being sent to
      Cherry Point Marine Base in North Carolina. There he flew 'dawn patrol' up and
      down the Atlantic coast hoping to catch submarines when they surfaced.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tWhen Raschio returned to Portland on
      leave, he found that his soon-to-be wife, Maria, had organized everything for
      their wedding, and he was married to her during his two week stay before reporting
      back for his military service.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEventually Raschio was commissioned to a heavy cruiser in
      Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed around through the Panama Canal to its homeport
      of San Francisco. From there the ship became involved in the WWII fight for
      the Marshall Islands. He risked his life many times while aboard, surviving
      hurricanes and monsoons that tossed the cruiser in every direction, and flying
      reconnaissance missions in small planes catapulted off the deck of the ship.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tOn one of these
      missions, when flying over an enemy island, Raschio noticed a small track leading
      away from the airstrip. To get a closer look, he flew down to an altitude of
      500 feet, all while evading enemy fire, and saw that the track led to a building
      that he could only presume must be an ammunition dump, strategically placed
      away from the airfield to avoid U.S. bombing. Immediately after landing, he
      reported to the General Quarters of the friendly ship that retrieved him, showing
      the commander where to fire the ship's guns in an attempt to hit the building.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tAs stated in the
      USS Hale historical records, \"The highlight of this week, which even now is
      unsurpassed, was that fuel dump the Hale touched off in one of the night bombardments.

    - "<p>\n                \tThe house on the Willamette riverfront in which retired
      Franklin science teacher Dario Raschio was born has been demolished for years,
      but Saint Michael's Parish still stands just a quarter mile west, surrounded
      by the tall gray buildings that now make up downtown Portland. This is where
      Raschio was baptized, had his First Communion, and where his children and grandchildren
      have been baptized as well.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tRaschio
      celebrated his 100th birthday on November 10, his church outdating him by about
      20 years, having been founded in 1894 by Italian Catholic immigrants. Portland's
      'Little Italy' neighborhood, where Raschio grew up. has since been developed
      almost to the point of being unrecognizable, but Saint Michael the Archangel
      Catholic Parish serves as a reminder of the area's history.\n                </p>\n

      \               \tAfter attending grade school at St. Michael's, Raschio went
      to St. Stephen's High School in SE Portland, where he remembers playing baseball
      against Franklin. After high school, he enrolled in the pharmacy program at
      North Pacific College, but transferred to OSU a year later, switching into the
      PreMed program, and ultimately into teaching.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tIt was difficult to find work in the heart of the Great Depression,
      and Raschio applied for all kinds of jobs across the state before finally getting
      a letter granting him an interview for a teaching position in Gold Beach, OR.
      At the same time, he received a telegram offering him a job as a government
      clerk in Washington, D.C. The job in Gold Beach would have only paid $85 a month,
      while the job being handed to him in D.C. paid $100 a month, so Raschio traveled
      across the country to the capital. Two years later, in September 1941, a gathering
      was held in D.C. where the names of ten men were drawn for the ceremonial part
      of the army draft.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \t\"Guess
      who was one of the ten? Lucky me,\" Raschio jokes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tHe didn't want to be a footsoldier, so he requested a transfer
      to the navy and was able to start flight training on December 1, 1941. A week
      later the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, commencing the U.S.'s involvement in
      World War II, so Raschio went through his training and ended up being sent to
      Cherry Point Marine Base in North Carolina. There he flew 'dawn patrol' up and
      down the Atlantic coast hoping to catch submarines when they surfaced.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tWhen Raschio returned to Portland on
      leave, he found that his soon-to-be wife, Maria, had organized everything for
      their wedding, and he was married to her during his two week stay before reporting
      back for his military service.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEventually Raschio was commissioned to a heavy cruiser in
      Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed around through the Panama Canal to its homeport
      of San Francisco. From there the ship became involved in the WWII fight for
      the Marshall Islands. He risked his life many times while aboard, surviving
      hurricanes and monsoons that tossed the cruiser in every direction, and flying
      reconnaissance missions in small planes catapulted off the deck of the ship.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tOn one of these
      missions, when flying over an enemy island, Raschio noticed a small track leading
      away from the airstrip. To get a closer look, he flew down to an altitude of
      500 feet, all while evading enemy fire, and saw that the track led to a building
      that he could only presume must be an ammunition dump, strategically placed
      away from the airfield to avoid U.S. bombing. Immediately after landing, he
      reported to the General Quarters of the friendly ship that retrieved him, showing
      the commander where to fire the ship's guns in an attempt to hit the building.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tAs stated in the
      USS Hale historical records, \"The highlight of this week, which even now is
      unsurpassed, was that fuel dump the Hale touched off in one of the night bombardments.
      Enormous blasts of flame and smoke could be seen for miles out to sea. Never
      a 4th of July celebration back home was seen as colorful as this.\"\n                </p>\n

    - The 2014 trends transitioning from Fall to Winter
    - 'This year''s fall and winter fashion are all about keeping warm! You can''t
      walk the streets of Portland without girls dressed in black skinny jeans, a
      chunky sweater, black boots, and knee high socks. Current trends are "sweater
      dresses and fuzzy scarves" according to Natalie Tonneson, Management Key Holder
      at Sloan Boutique. Expect a lot of royal blue and gold at stores because of
      the holiday season. If you''re looking for something affordable, American Apparel
      has a great option: a red velvet crop top. It looks good with black jeans, bringing
      out the color of the shirt.'

      can be difficult to make use of shorts and dresses from Summer. A way to incorporate
      shorts into your wardrobe for winter, is to pair colorful tights or thigh highs
      with a button up and some black booties. Layering is a great option that can
      add color to an outfit. Knit sweaters, leggings, and beanies, are a stylish
      way to keep warm. One outfit idea could be wearing leggings with black boots
      and an oversized sweater.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are looking for a way to change
      up your style for the holidays, Tonneson's advice is to try something that is
      out of your normal style and comfort zone. Try walking into a store and grabbing
      something you like even if you wouldn't wear it normally. American Apparel and
      Sloan boutique are both great places to find affordable and stylish winter fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere
      are also trends for guys fashion. Examples of trends in men fashion would be
      the over shirt, the down vest (the perfect fall layering piece), a casual sweatshirt,
      and some timbers. These are great pieces to transition from fall to winter.
      Most of them you are able to find in your closet.\n</p>"

      Angeles surfboard designer Shawn Stussy, in the early 1980's, released a line
      of t-shirts with his surfboard logo, \"Stussy\" on the front. He started by
      selling the shirts out of the back of his van on boardwalks, but as the iconic
      design grew, the birth of a fashion style that would forever change the industry
      occurred: Streetwear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Streetwear is a hard to define term, as
      it is such a broad market. While you can see streetwear brands everywhere, the
      core concept behind its popularity is \"exclusiveness.\" The idea of buying
      clothing that has a limited stock has attracted a huge following. But what many
      don't see is the source pushing the product, Hip-Hop.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLook at
      any famous rapper from 1980 till now. The style that an artist wears plays a
      big part in their image. Notorious B.I.G., for example, referenced clothing
      companies in many of his verses, like \"I put h**s in NY onto DKNY, Miami, D.C.
      prefer Versace.\" Sporting high-end brands has always been a statement of wealth
      and power. Jewelry and clothing from brands such as Gucci, Versace, Dolce &amp;
      Gabbana, and Timberland have been an icon in Hip-Hop. Artists had their own
      special trend that stuck with their following; Wu-tang Clan and Carhart, Biggie
      and DKNY. But as inflation kicked in, and the economic class widened, Hip-Hop
      looked for a more DIY market to push.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2003, Pharrell, lead
      emcee of Rap-rock band N.E.R.D, started wearing around a t-shirt with a camo
      Ape Stencil and the words, \"A Bathing Ape.\" The brand, created by Japanese
      Designer Nigo, gained a rapid following. Artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne,
      and Kid Cudi, started sporting the brand. Soon the company would plant themselves
      as one of the most recognizable brands in streetwear fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOdd
      Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, the LA-based rap collective led by rapper Tyler
      the Creator, had a huge influence in the streetwear world. They caught the music
      industry's attention for their explicit, violent, and rude humor that attracted
      the liking of many teens. The group gave themselves an image, which greatly
      helped local clothing company Supreme. Odd Future constantly wore the brands
      iconic \"box logo\" tee in many performances and interviews. As they gained
      popularity, so did Supreme. Due to the company's size, many of their lines had
      a limited number of prints, giving each item even more hype. While Odd Future
      has now started their own brand, and doesn't work with Supreme, the LA brand
      is still in the spotlight of street fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, one
      of the biggest names in the Hip-Hop industry, Kanye West. He has always been
      a landmark figure in the fashion industry. His portfolio is massive. He has
      landed deals to design for A.P.C, Adidas, and his most famous Nike Air Yeezy's,
      which have been listed on Ebay for as much as 16.3 million dollars. He has helped
      create the style of \"Street-Goth,\" which has recently been a growing style
      in Hip-Hop culture. West continues to make a name in the fashion world, recently
      selling a plain white t-shirt for $120.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere will Hip-Hop take
      fashion next? That is a question that is on most streetwear designers minds.
      As of now, it has taken a turn. A$ap Rocky, the New York emcee and front man
      for A$ap Mob, recently released a single in which he calls out prominent streetwear
      brands Been Trill and Hood By Air for not giving him credit for representing
      their brands. This created a hot discussion among fans of the brand on many
      fashion forums. For now, the drama has settled, but this could start problems
      for both the brands and the artists who represent it. Hip-Hop has always made
      a long standing impact on many businesses, whether it be cars, alcohol, or clothing.
      The future of fashion is unknown, but wherever it goes, Hip-Hop will always
      be involved.\n</p>"

      occurred: Streetwear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Streetwear is a hard to define term, as
      it is such a broad market. While you can see streetwear brands everywhere, the
      core concept behind its popularity is \"exclusiveness.\" The idea of buying
      clothing that has a limited stock has attracted a huge following. But what many
      don't see is the source pushing the product, Hip-Hop.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLook at
      any famous rapper from 1980 till now. The style that an artist wears plays a
      big part in their image. Notorious B.I.G., for example, referenced clothing
      companies in many of his verses, like \"I put h**s in NY onto DKNY, Miami, D.C.
      prefer Versace.\" Sporting high-end brands has always been a statement of wealth
      and power. Jewelry and clothing from brands such as Gucci, Versace, Dolce &amp;
      Gabbana, and Timberland have been an icon in Hip-Hop. Artists had their own
      special trend that stuck with their following; Wu-tang Clan and Carhart, Biggie
      and DKNY. But as inflation kicked in, and the economic class widened, Hip-Hop
      looked for a more DIY market to push.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2003, Pharrell, lead
      emcee of Rap-rock band N.E.R.D, started wearing around a t-shirt with a camo
      Ape Stencil and the words, \"A Bathing Ape.\" The brand, created by Japanese
      Designer Nigo, gained a rapid following. Artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne,
      and Kid Cudi, started sporting the brand. Soon the company would plant themselves
      as one of the most recognizable brands in streetwear fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOdd
      Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, the LA-based rap collective led by rapper Tyler
      the Creator, had a huge influence in the streetwear world. They caught the music
      industry's attention for their explicit, violent, and rude humor that attracted
      the liking of many teens. The group gave themselves an image, which greatly
      helped local clothing company Supreme. Odd Future constantly wore the brands
      iconic \"box logo\" tee in many performances and interviews. As they gained
      popularity, so did Supreme. Due to the company's size, many of their lines had
      a limited number of prints, giving each item even more hype. While Odd Future
      has now started their own brand, and doesn't work with Supreme, the LA brand
      is still in the spotlight of street fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, one
      of the biggest names in the Hip-Hop industry, Kanye West. He has always been
      a landmark figure in the fashion industry. His portfolio is massive. He has
      landed deals to design for A.P.C, Adidas, and his most famous Nike Air Yeezy's,
      which have been listed on Ebay for as much as 16.3 million dollars. He has helped
      create the style of \"Street-Goth,\" which has recently been a growing style
      in Hip-Hop culture. West continues to make a name in the fashion world, recently
      selling a plain white t-shirt for $120.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere will Hip-Hop take
      fashion next? That is a question that is on most streetwear designers minds.
      As of now, it has taken a turn. A$ap Rocky, the New York emcee and front man
      for A$ap Mob, recently released a single in which he calls out prominent streetwear
      brands Been Trill and Hood By Air for not giving him credit for representing
      their brands. This created a hot discussion among fans of the brand on many
      fashion forums. For now, the drama has settled, but this could start problems
      for both the brands and the artists who represent it. Hip-Hop has always made
      a long standing impact on many businesses, whether it be cars, alcohol, or clothing.
      The future of fashion is unknown, but wherever it goes, Hip-Hop will always
      be involved.\n</p>"

    - Seniors Pull Through with Victory in Powderpuff
    - '"I like how it brings everyone together."'
    - One of Franklin's many annual traditions is Powderpuff, a fundraiser football
      game for the senior class where the players are girls and the cheerleaders are
      guys. Powderpuff not only allows for camaraderie between the male and female
      athletes, but also for fun in an unconventional way.

      compromised by the expectation of winning. \"I think actually they might be
      at a disadvantage because I think they're so psyched out about winning,\" he
      said. \"Some of them are going to be focused on winning, and not really focused

      is not only a fun game, some view it as a way to switch the gender roles and
      gain some understanding of what the other gender experiences.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t\"Powderpuff shows guys that cheer is
      actually hard,\" said Tanna Haney (11), a cheerleader. \"Powderpuff shows our
      school what it is to be in different roles, like the boys cheering, because
      at Franklin, you can cheer if you're a guy, but no one does it, and you can
      also play football at Franklin if you're a girl, but no one does that either,
      so it's just showing them that they could do it and how much fun it would be.\"\n

    - Cross Country Finishes Season Strong
    - Franklin cross country is getting ready to come back even stronger for track
      season.
    - After a season full of learning experiences, the cross country team is looking
      forward to next season. Henry Mong, the only mens' state qualifier stated, "I
      think it was a good season. In the beginning we were the clear underdogs. We
      would have had to have a perfect day to have gone to state as a team. The district
      meet was hard and a little frustrating that we didn't make it, but it was a
      good learning experience with great competition."

    - Bus Stop
    - ''
    - It was raining. Of course it was Oregon, but even so, it usually didn't rain
      <em>this</em> much. The rain misted as it bounced off the sidewalk, thoroughly
      soaking my shoes. Grimacing, I stepped into the deluge and was immediately deafened
      by the sound of the rain as it pounded my rain jacket. The huge Douglas fir
      tree by my house benevolently spread its furry needles, creating an umbrella;
      but I couldn't stay sheltered. The bus doesn't wait if you are late.

      but I couldn't stay sheltered. The bus doesn't wait if you are late.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      crossed the wet street and stood next to the stop, watching the water droplets
      slither down my sleeve and plunge onto the sidewalk. My breath looked like an
      ancient dragon's smoke. The rain seeped through my jacket, and I shivered from
      the cold and damp. <em>This bus better come soon</em>, I thought anxiously,
      <em>preferably before I get completely soaked.</em> A sudden gust of wind flung
      icy droplets at my face. I got the feeling that the rain didn't like me, which
      was silly really. Just as another raindrop hit me-\n</p>\n<p>\n\t I woke up,
      gasping. I had the strangest sense of menace… as if something in my dream had
      been chasing me. An owl hooted, and I jumped. Then I remembered. I was lost
      in the forest, on a backpacking trip.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Get ahold of yourself!\"
      I could just barely see by the light of the crisp fall moon. It had started
      to rain; I looked up, another droplet landed on my forehead. I shivered, and
      not just from the cold, I was scared; terrified actually. <em>Why did I have
      to get lost</em>? I asked myself despairingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEverything went
      south by day two. I wasn't too pleased by the rain when I'd woken up, but like
      I said, this is Oregon. Folding up the tent after breakfast, I entered the trail.
      A while later, I pulled out the satellite phone (to call my boyfriend) when
      I tripped over a root. The phone broke when it landed in a puddle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"No!\"
      <em>This is bad, very bad</em>, I thought worriedly. I quickly checked myself,
      and was glad to find, injury-free. The phone was my bigger concern. If I got
      into trouble, I'd be all alone.. In my panic, I had to turn back and got lost
      along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDay five dawned cold and gray. I had three more
      meals worth of food, but my main problem was exposure. With no tent, all I had
      was a cheap sleeping bag. Now I was in a state of perma-dampness. It was still
      dark, around five a.m. And suddenly, like an unwelcome beast, the rain returned
      with vengeance. I shivered, and as if it sensed my weakness, it stole my warmth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPacking
      up my sleeping bag, I set off on the trail, ignoring the rain. But the rain
      didn't want to be ignored. Two or three hours later, the rain had increased
      in tempo, and the wind seemed intent on blowing me into the ground. I was starting
      to become distressed. I was even more lost now than before. I slipped in the
      mud and had just stood when the sky split in two with a terrible peal of thunder.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith
      a terrified cry I ran from the rain as it roared to life, surging toward me.
      It took the shape of a serpent, and slithered closer…and closer… and closer.
      It spit, and water droplets hit my face. I bolted away, but slipped, and the
      rain loomed over me. I closed my eyes and-\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was in my room, my
      real room, awake this time.<em> Must have been the cold medicine</em>, I thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t'Oh,
      I didn't mean to wake you. I was just changing the cloth on your forehead,\"
      said my mom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \"Mom? I just had the weirdest dream! I was waiting
      at the bus stop, and then I was lost in a forest!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Mom?\" I
      asked. A sudden chill overcame me. She was gone. My gaze roved over the room,
      and I fixated on my window. Outside, it had just started to rain…\n</p>"

      the cold and damp. <em>This bus better come soon</em>, I thought anxiously,
      <em>preferably before I get completely soaked.</em> A sudden gust of wind flung
      icy droplets at my face. I got the feeling that the rain didn't like me, which
      was silly really. Just as another raindrop hit me-\n</p>\n<p>\n\t I woke up,
      gasping. I had the strangest sense of menace… as if something in my dream had
      been chasing me. An owl hooted, and I jumped. Then I remembered. I was lost
      in the forest, on a backpacking trip.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Get ahold of yourself!\"
      I could just barely see by the light of the crisp fall moon. It had started
      to rain; I looked up, another droplet landed on my forehead. I shivered, and
      not just from the cold, I was scared; terrified actually. <em>Why did I have
      to get lost</em>? I asked myself despairingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEverything went
      south by day two. I wasn't too pleased by the rain when I'd woken up, but like
      I said, this is Oregon. Folding up the tent after breakfast, I entered the trail.
      A while later, I pulled out the satellite phone (to call my boyfriend) when
      I tripped over a root. The phone broke when it landed in a puddle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"No!\"
      <em>This is bad, very bad</em>, I thought worriedly. I quickly checked myself,
      and was glad to find, injury-free. The phone was my bigger concern. If I got
      into trouble, I'd be all alone.. In my panic, I had to turn back and got lost
      along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDay five dawned cold and gray. I had three more
      meals worth of food, but my main problem was exposure. With no tent, all I had
      was a cheap sleeping bag. Now I was in a state of perma-dampness. It was still
      dark, around five a.m. And suddenly, like an unwelcome beast, the rain returned
      with vengeance. I shivered, and as if it sensed my weakness, it stole my warmth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPacking
      up my sleeping bag, I set off on the trail, ignoring the rain. But the rain
      didn't want to be ignored. Two or three hours later, the rain had increased
      in tempo, and the wind seemed intent on blowing me into the ground. I was starting
      to become distressed. I was even more lost now than before. I slipped in the
      mud and had just stood when the sky split in two with a terrible peal of thunder.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith
      a terrified cry I ran from the rain as it roared to life, surging toward me.
      It took the shape of a serpent, and slithered closer…and closer… and closer.
      It spit, and water droplets hit my face. I bolted away, but slipped, and the
      rain loomed over me. I closed my eyes and-\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was in my room, my
      real room, awake this time.<em> Must have been the cold medicine</em>, I thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t'Oh,
      I didn't mean to wake you. I was just changing the cloth on your forehead,\"
      said my mom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \"Mom? I just had the weirdest dream! I was waiting
      at the bus stop, and then I was lost in a forest!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Mom?\" I
      asked. A sudden chill overcame me. She was gone. My gaze roved over the room,
      and I fixated on my window. Outside, it had just started to rain…\n</p>"

      \       <p>\n        \tThe old lady's house stood at the base of a grand oak
      tree, which drooped and swayed in the wind, branches creaking. The house had
      been there so long that the tree had grown around it, its trunk breaking the
      walls and its branches poking through the roof. Even from where Aster was standing
      she could hear the house groaning beneath the behemoth's weight, and she could
      smell its herbs and molds and powders and poultices. Benjamin eagerly leaped
      from the cart and ran ahead, ignoring the fat black sheep which grazed on patches
      of cropped shrubbery. Aster reached the wide, wooden door and knocked. It swung
      open, hinges screeching, and silhouetted in the yellow light of the doorway,
      stood the hag. She was somewhere in her mid-sixties, but looked much older,
      her skin wrinkled and weathered from the sun, her hair brilliant-silver, wild,
      and wiry. Her eyes held laughter, but her mouth was puckered distastefully.\n

      High School was closed in 2011, when the PPS School Board voted to consolidate
      high school students in SE Portland by relocating Marshall students to Franklin
      and Madison. Marshall is located on SE 91st Ave, about two miles east of Franklin.&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2014-12-11T13:21:10.000-08:00&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2015-03-17T12:43:13.000-07:00&quot;,&quot;pending_initial_edit&quot;:true},{&quot;id&quot;:118,&quot;video&quot;:false,&quot;user_id&quot;:6,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;2.JPG&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Stevie

    - Shakespeare Power
    - ''
    - Engineers from the UK's University of Warwick have constructed a ground breaking
      experimental generator which converts the rotational force generated by 16th
      century poet and playwright William Shakespeare as he rolls in his grave. The
      small power station, constructed atop the grave of the famous thespian, at the
      Chancel of the Holy Trinity Church in his home town of Stratford-upon-Avon,
      generates an average of 1.5 megawatts of power each day, roughly equal to the
      output of a small onshore wind turbine.  Team leader Edmund Norwich and chief
      researcher Alice Thompson explained the concept behind the generator.

      putting Garner into an illegal chokehold and tackling him to the ground as he
      tried to let the officer know he couldn't breathe. The verdict from the jury

    - With e-sports, or "electronic sports," rapidly climbing in popularity, many
      wonder if they should truly be categorized as sports. A sport is defined as
      an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or
      team competes against another or others for entertainment.

      consequences about increased digital immigration. \"They're taken' our server

    - The Living Review

    - Looking for an exciting adventure book? Then <em>The Living</em>, by Matt De
      La Peña is your answer. The main character is Shy, a half Mexican teen working
      a simple summer job on a cruise ship, although his life is far from care-free.
      His grandmother died from Romero's disease, and now his nephew has it too. He
      witnessed a suicide and now someone is watching him. Shy once was only concerned
      for his family, until a massive earthquake that's been predicted to hit the
      West coast occurs and sends multiple tsunamis towards his cruise ship. Now Shy
      aims to get back to his family in California, survive the storm, and unravel
      the mysteries of Romero's disease, which has been plaguing his family.

      book features strong characters, Shy being one of the strongest. The evolution
      of Shy's character is what makes him so interesting and relatable. At the beginning,
      he is a regular teen whose only concern is if his salary will \"be enough to
      help his mom out and still score some new gear and a pair of kicks, maybe take
      a female out to dinner\" (1). At the book's conclusion, he is a toughened survivor;
      Shy has to beat up a shark with an oar to save his food. Not to mention, his
      only company is fellow survivor, Addie.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother great aspect of
      the book is the suspense; De La Peña keeps the reader wondering what will happen
      next. One of the best examples from the book is when Shy is waiting for the
      second tsunami wave to hit and he \"saw a second rise in the distance, this
      one building farther out and already more massive, and he knew immediately they
      wouldn't make it over\" (147).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Living</em> is not lacking
      a good plot either, because once Shy has time to talk to Addie, he discovers
      her father could have part of the answer to Romero's disease. I enjoyed going
      along for the ride as Shy uncovered the truth about his survival and Romero's
      disease. Overall, I recommend <em>The Living</em> for its suspense, character
      development and interesting plot.\n</p>"

    - EU Parliament Votes to Divide Google Search Engine, Other Services
    - ''
    - On November 27, 2014, the European Parliament passed a measure to break up Google,
      the company behind the world's most popular search engine. The vote is nonbinding,
      meaning it cannot be enforced as law, but it's the latest event in a series
      of disagreements between Google and the European Union (EU) regarding the latter's
      policies on the handling of citizens' data and privacy.

    - Aster crouched on the floor next to the oven, using the end of a broomstick
      to prod at its massive underbelly. She could hear the small man laughing and
      see him scuttling around when she pressed her eye to the floor. It was growing
      dark and Ms. Black had long since retired to her room. Benjamin snored from
      his spot by the fire.

      out, man. I just want to talk,\" Aster said, casting aside the broom. \"See?
      No weapons, it's a fair fight.\" The little man snorted in response and drops
      of saliva flew from beneath the stove, hitting Aster in the face. Recoiling,
      she leaned back on her ankles and rose from the floor. She began pushing the
      oven, and grunting, she turned, pressing her back against its cast-iron side.
      The thing was at least three times her weight, and the effort caused her to
      fall backwards against a tall, teetering shelf which held an array of small
      glass jars. The shelf wobbled slightly, causing several of the jars to fall,
      and a spray of glass spattered like rainfall across the floor. Aster looked
      up from the floor and watched as a tendril of pink smoke rose upward and curled
      around her feet. The smoke tickled around her thighs and made its way up her
      legs, bringing with it a burning, fuzzy sensation. Aster found that her head
      was heavy and her limbs were weakened. Eyes drooping, Aster saw the little man
      silhouetted against the bright light of the fire, shaking with laughter, before
      drifting off into oblivion.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n

      opened her eyes and was faced with the sight of a great, looming mass of darkness
      with curving sides. All around her were strangely shaped, clear, jagged objects,
      and semi transparent pink liquid, which glinted in the light of a vast pillar
      of flame. Aster's first thought was that the old woman's house was on fire;
      she had blacked out from sheer exhaustion and the fire had caught upon some
      stray dust speck, or perhaps a clump of Benjamin's hair. Aster rose to her feet,
      and discovered that she was covered in the thick, pink liquid, which was sticky
      and sweetly-scented. Quite suddenly she found herself smothered by a massive
      wet object. Rousing herself, she turned and was faced with an enormous furry
      snout and a pair of smiling teeth.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n

      licked Aster once again; the entirety of his tongue was nearly half the size
      of her body and the severity of the licking knocked her from her feet. Fortunately,
      the dog seemed to recognize Aster as a friend and was not making an attempt
      to eat her, however it had become apparent to her that she was tiny, and a clear
      target for less-forgiving creatures. Benjamin's ears pricked up and he began
      to emit a low, menacing growl which reverberated the air and sent shivers down
      Aster's spine. From across the room came a shriek, and a stampede of small,
      ravaged men came tumbling towards Aster. Benjamin planted himself in front of
      Aster, forming a massive canine shield as the men neared her location. Soon
      the air filled with Benjamin's howling and the indistinguishable chanting of

    - ''
    - The 1960's were all about change, especially for the youth, many of whom wanted
      to rebel against any issue they could find. They grew out their hair, wore taboo
      clothing, and listened to nothing but rock. As the era of peace and love came
      to an end, so did the world wide music phenomenon which inspired kids throughout
      the decades. The rapid advancements in technology drove rock and roll straight
      into the ground. As the music industry turned digital, so did the artists, and
      the results spread like a wildfire, creating a billion dollar industry that
      some regard as the next "rock and roll."

      \               <p>\n                \t EDM, short for Electronic Dance Music,
      has been around for about 30 years, starting in the mid-80's with the invention
      of the keyboard and drum machine. It became wildly popular in European countries
      in the 90's. A slow underground movement started to form in North America and
      by the mid 2000's, EDM was set to be the next big thing.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t Daft Punk, a music duo from Paris, gave
      the media an outlet for putting electronic music in the headlines. Their 2006
      performance at the Coachella music festival was regarded by the legendary music
      magazine <em>Spin</em> as the \"tipping point\" in the evolution of the electronic
      music era. Soon, dj's such as Deadmau5 and David Guetta began receiving national
      attention for their chart topping remixes and heart-pounding shows. Music labels
      and concert promoters caught on to the trend. Electronic shows, known mainly
      as \"raves,\" brought in huge crowds who would buy multiple drinks and stay
      till one or two in the morning. Promoters started hosting more and more electronic
      shows in prominent clubs and high-capacity venues. The outcome was beyond successful.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \t The rise of electronic
      music is mostly thanks to the world wide web. Sites like Youtube and recently
      Soundcloud have provided a huge outlet for up-and-coming producers and dj's
      to gain headway into the industry. It has also helped many festivals and concerts
      receive extra attention. Tomorrowland, the annual 3 day electronic music festival
      held in Belgium, has received endless promotion from Youtube. The festival's
      2011 \"Official Aftermovie,\" a 20 minute montage of concert footage and festival
      attendees, has almost 70 million views. Then in 2013, all of the tickets sold
      out in approximately 35 minutes, and the festival had over 200,000 patrons in
      attendance and over 86 million views on the aftermovie. The attendance at Tomorrowland
      2013 was a little over half as much as Woodstock.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \t Electronic dance music is nowhere near dying. The billion
      dollar industry surrounding the heavy bass and flashing lights is only growing.
      But how is this the next \"rock and roll\"? Electronic music's targeted audience
      is approximately between the ages of 13-30. The popularity of clubs and raves
      has also caused a significant rise in drug use, similar to the drug problem
      in the 60's. There is a growing culture behind the genre too; many fans dress
      in neon colors, sporting bracelets and light-up accessories. EDM has taken over
      a majority of radio play, been the main focus of the music industry, and is
      played in most stores and supermarkets as if it were elevator music. Electronic
      music is everywhere, and the industry behind it can only grow from here.\n                </p>"

      by the mid 2000's, EDM was set to be the next big thing.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t Daft Punk, a music duo from Paris, gave
      the media an outlet for putting electronic music in the headlines. Their 2006
      performance at the Coachella music festival was regarded by the legendary music
      magazine <em>Spin</em> as the \"tipping point\" in the evolution of the electronic
      music era. Soon, dj's such as Deadmau5 and David Guetta began receiving national
      attention for their chart topping remixes and heart-pounding shows. Music labels
      and concert promoters caught on to the trend. Electronic shows, known mainly
      as \"raves,\" brought in huge crowds who would buy multiple drinks and stay
      till one or two in the morning. Promoters started hosting more and more electronic
      shows in prominent clubs and high-capacity venues. The outcome was beyond successful.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \t The rise of electronic
      music is mostly thanks to the world wide web. Sites like Youtube and recently
      Soundcloud have provided a huge outlet for up-and-coming producers and dj's
      to gain headway into the industry. It has also helped many festivals and concerts
      receive extra attention. Tomorrowland, the annual 3 day electronic music festival
      held in Belgium, has received endless promotion from Youtube. The festival's
      2011 \"Official Aftermovie,\" a 20 minute montage of concert footage and festival
      attendees, has almost 70 million views. Then in 2013, all of the tickets sold
      out in approximately 35 minutes, and the festival had over 200,000 patrons in
      attendance and over 86 million views on the aftermovie. The attendance at Tomorrowland
      2013 was a little over half as much as Woodstock.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \t Electronic dance music is nowhere near dying. The billion
      dollar industry surrounding the heavy bass and flashing lights is only growing.
      But how is this the next \"rock and roll\"? Electronic music's targeted audience
      is approximately between the ages of 13-30. The popularity of clubs and raves
      has also caused a significant rise in drug use, similar to the drug problem
      in the 60's. There is a growing culture behind the genre too; many fans dress
      in neon colors, sporting bracelets and light-up accessories. EDM has taken over
      a majority of radio play, been the main focus of the music industry, and is
      played in most stores and supermarkets as if it were elevator music. Electronic
      music is everywhere, and the industry behind it can only grow from here.\n                </p>"

    - Blazers Tip-Off to an Amazing Start
    - ''
    - The Portland Trail Blazers have started out another season very well with a
      26-8, 34-game record, building on their success from last season where they
      made it to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in 14 years.
      The Blazers are poised for another playoffs sitting atop their conference. Still,
      the season is far from over, and with injuries starting to plague the Blazers,
      the bench has to show up.

    - Public Wi-Fi to Expand in New York City
    - ''
    - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced an ambitious new project to
      bring Wi-Fi access to the entire city. The plan would involve placing kiosks,
      with free domestic calling and advertisements, all across the city that broadcast
      a Wi-Fi hotspot to which users can connect their devices.

    - Career or Hobby?
    - On October 31, 2007, Tyler Oakley, teenage gay rights advocate, uploaded a game-changing
      broadcast to the online video sharing site, YouTube. What was so different about
      this video? Instead of the usual music film, sports clip, or funny home video,
      it was just a teen talking to a camera. He wasn't delivering any sort of speech,
      sales pitch, or rehearsed script. It was like he was having a conversation with
      the person on the other end of the camera. Soon, the trend caught on. People,
      mostly teens, were recording themselves stating an opinion, talking about a
      cause they believe in, answering questions from viewers, or just making jokes.

      has a similar belief. \"Personally, YouTube is more of a hobby, but those who
      use it as a career have become really successful. They started their channels
      as hobbies, but the fact that they have been able to make careers out of it

      good starting point to kick off a career.\n                                                </p>\n

      mostly teens, were recording themselves stating an opinion, talking about a
      cause they believe in, answering questions from viewers, or just making jokes.\n

      debate about whether YouTube can go beyond a hobby and be a place to build a

      Cybelle Corwin is an aspiring YouTuber, and she believes that YouTube can be
      a platform or foundation to build off of.\n                                                </p>\n

      I think YouTube can be whatever you make of it. If you want it to be a hobby,
      that totally works, but if you dedicate yourself enough and put yourself out
      there, you can make it more!\" Kate Brown, another YouTuber from Cleveland,
      has a similar belief. \"Personally, YouTube is more of a hobby, but those who
      use it as a career have become really successful. They started their channels
      as hobbies, but the fact that they have been able to make careers out of it
      is really interesting because its something they enjoy, but can also use it
      as a way to make a living for themselves,\" she said.\n                                                </p>\n

      Pulscak (10) has a slightly different opinion on the debate. She believes that
      a career can't be made solely by publishing YouTube videos, but it can be a
      good starting point to kick off a career.\n                                                </p>\n

      and Hank Green are a good example of a solid career made on YouTube. Their channel,
      VlogBrothers, is made up of informative videos ranging from the topics of ancient
      world history to chemistry. They have reached moderate fame from this endeavour,
      and make a profit.\n                                                </p>\n                                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tWhat is the appeal of being
      a YouTuber? \"My aim is to express and show others what I'm passionate about.
      It's a great way to stay involved in the things I enjoy while school is going,\"
      says Corwin. Elijah Barto, Central Catholic sophomore, says for him the appeal
      is that one can pick their own hours and be generally self-motivated to provide
      for themselves.\n                                                </p>\n                                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tOverall, the teen consensus
      seems to be that YouTube alone isn't a reliable career path, but one can build
      up from there.\n                                                </p>"

      a world of turmoil. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl
      at the head of an uprising against the authoritarian powers in The Capitol.
      Simultaneously, Katniss also must decide who she is in love with: her long time
      friend and protector, Gale, ( Liam Hemsworth) or Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the
      boy who Katniss met in the first movie and fought with against The Capitol (the

      expertly portrayed the strong feelings of sadness and anger that Katniss felt.
      This installment of <em>The Hunger Games</em> had a much higher budget than
      it's two predecessors, which made the action scenes more intense. Despite the
      lack of fighting scenes, it was actually more engaging because the protests
      against the government seemed more relevant to the current situation in the
      world. The movie also delved deeper into the main characters' personalities
      by having more scenes filled with conversation as opposed to action.\n                </p>\n

    - Franklin Staff Bonds Through Bowl Bash
    - ''
    - Each year, the number of Division 1 College Football Bowl games grows and grows,
      and this year is no exception. With the addition of the College Football Playoff,
      the number swelled to 39 games. That number would cause any psychic to balk
      at predicting every outcome, but that didn't stop many of Franklin's staff from
      attempting to do just that.

    - According to a 2011 National Sleep Foundation poll, 95% of people surveyed actively
      use some sort of technology for at least an hour most nights before bed. "I
      honestly find that it makes me super tired so I always go on certain apps until
      I get sleepy," says Anna Pulscak (10).

      and shutting off all technology an hour before you plan to fall asleep. Many

      generally better for your body than going to bed later. \"If we do what our

      window sills, and people perform snow dances in the streets as they pray Portland
      will have one of those snowy holidays that are so rare in the Pacific Northwest.

      favorite style of art is semi realism, but she dabbles in other styles as well.
      \"I like to do semi realism drawing, occasionally an Anime-like style, sometimes
      chibi. But semi realism is my main style,\" Nokham said. Her writing utensil
      of choice is the Paper Mate Clearpoint® 0.5 Black Mechanical Pencil. \"I use
      them because they bring a nice, firm feeling to my hand. I like to have something
      that's nice and strong to keep my hand stable with when drawing,\" said Nokham.
      Nokham's inspiration comes from her best friend, Angela Chanthavong. \"She loved
      to draw, and would frequently invite me along to draw as well.\" Nokham said.
      Her best piece is a drawing of her original character Ray, a royal prince. Nokham
      likes the piece because she feels that it depicts Ray's elegance, and his royal
      personality.  Nokham credits her drawing skills to the right side of the brain,
      because it's filled with creative, imaginative, intuitive, and heuristic thoughts.
      To see Nokham's drawings, she can be found at Luna's Painting Studio on Fridays.\n

    - On November 20, President Barack Obama passed his rumored executive order regarding
      the issue of immigration reform. Obama pledged to take his own legislative action
      before the end of 2014, because of the constant gridlock within Congress during
      the past few years of his term.

      \                               \tThe new executive order did not have to pass
      through Congress; President Obama only had to sign it to put it into law for
      the rest of his term. Executive orders are not as common as federal legislation,
      because Congress can usually come to a compromise on issues. The exception is
      when party members in the houses stay steadfast to their principles, creating
      partisan gridlock. Obama's executive order on immigration will affect close
      to 5 million immigrants who are now in America, and includes three main objectives
      to make immigration safer and fairer for everyone involved.\n                                </p>\n

      action that Obama wants to take is to enhance the security at the border in
      order to prevent further illegal immigration to the United States. In terms
      of deporting illegal immigrants already in the United States, the order prioritizes
      criminals, not families, and allows the undocumented immigrants who are contributing
      to society economically to stay.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tThe final item that President Obama included
      in the order was the placement of criminal and background checks for undocumented
      children of U.S. citizens, who have been living in the United States for at
      least five years. With proper test results, the children are allowed to stay
      in the United States, without repercussions, if temporarily. President Obama
      looks to have immigrants positively impact the economy, and become loyal citizens

      order was not the only prominent political action that President Obama took
      regarding foreign policy. In December 2014, Obama decided not to sign, and therefore
      terminated, the embargo on trade with Cuba. The embargo has lasted for over
      five decades.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tCongress can repass the executive action into
      law to maintain the embargo and this seems to be the intention of the Republican-majority
      Congress. Both the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and
      the Speaker of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, have publicly criticized Obama's

    - Failure of Measure 92 proves that elections can be bought in Oregon
    - 'Measure 92 was officially defeated  '
    - Oregon Ballot Measure 92, a grassroots initiative that would have required food
      manufacturers and retailers to label genetically modified foods, was officially
      defeated December 16, with the certification of a statewide, hand-recount of
      ballots. The final tally had the measure losing by an exceptionally slim margin
      of 837 votes, or about one twentieth of one percent of the total votes cast.
      The fate of the vote was shaped by the record-breaking spending of the 'No on
      92 Coalition,' which ran fear-mongering TV attack ads, funded by agrochemical
      and food giants, to mislead voters and score a narrow defeat of the measure.

      not matching the one the election office had on file. The campaign said in a

      of Michael Brown, Erik Garner, and Tamir Rice at the hands of police officers,
      and the decision that the man who shot Brown will not face charges. While the
      topic of police violence in America has fallen out of the news, in part due

      Portland more than 3000 protesters began their march in front of the city's
      Justice Center on SW 3rd, and followed a route that snaked through downtown,
      holding signs, shouting chants, and stopping traffic. The slogans \"Black lives
      matter\" and \"Hands up don't shoot,\" both popularized by social media and
      heard at protests across the country, were featured prominently in Portland.\n

      by the Albina Ministerial Alliance, a coalition of predominantly African American
      churches form North and Northeast Portland. The group has a long history of
      activism dating back to the civil rights era, and police violence is currently
      their primary issue.\n                                                        </p>\n

      involvement of this historic group highlights a growing divide among activists
      in America. Most marchers present at the Ferguson rallies fell into one of two
      camps, the older generation who have been active in civil disobedience since
      the 60's and 70's, and a new, younger group, many of whom got their start in
      the Occupy movement.\n                                                        </p>\n

      of these long time activists are fiercely loyal to the idles of 20<sup>th</sup>
      century leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., and it's evident in the way this
      march was organized; gospel inspired songs like \"we will overcome,\" silent
      moments of remembrance, and a candle light vigil for the deceased call back
      to a bygone era of American activism, when the church was a hotbed of political
      activism for many black Americans.\n                                                        </p>\n

      large part younger protesters were not happy with the AMA's handling of the
      demonstration. They favor a more aggressive form of resistance, while still
      non-violent, in their eyes they seek to force change rather than ask for it.
      Perhaps the most telling event at the rallies occurred while the organizers
      attempted to lead the group in a rendition of we will overcome from the steps
      of the Justice Center many in the crowd voiced their displeasure by erupting
      into a chant of \"No justice no peace.\"\n                                                        </p>\n

      protestors in the audience expressed that we need to try new methods to reduce
      police brutality, the methods we had been using before are clearly not fixing
      the issue. The leaders voiced how that change has happened; we just need to
      be patient. But how long are we willing to wait? Although our next step is not
      entirely clear, trying new nonviolent movements is our next approach. Getting
      people off their phones and onto the streets is a great start.\n                                                        </p>\n

      People feel really strongly one way or another, but they are not willing to
      put themselves out there. Getting people voting and protesting is our only option
      right now. Getting people voting shows that we do not agree with the way those
      things are currently and we need to fix it. If you are not voting, you are saying
      that you are okay with the way things are being run in the government and nothing
      needs to change. Most people do not feel this way, they are simply just not
      educated enough that they feel inclined they will make a good decision when
      voting.\n                                                        </p>\n                                                        <p>\n

      ended roughly an hour after it began, but many felt there was still work to
      be done. Abandoning the church organizers, the pre-planned route, and the police

      in protest.\n                                                        </p>\n

      choose to remain on the steps of the Justice Center, demanding answers from
      the organizers. \"You got us all together for an hour, gave a speech, and then
      told us to go home,\" shouted one demonstrator. While another I interviewed
      told me \"They gave everybody what they wanted, and they told us to go home.\"
      He continued, \"They were singing cumbia and all that bullshit, like everything's
      going to be okay, it's not going to be okay unless we act, and this isn't going
      to show anybody anything.\"\n                                                        </p>\n

      whether it's the government, or groups like AMA. Many feel disenfranchised,
      from politics that don't represent them, from schools that cost too much and
      deliver too little, and from political activist that give lofty speeches about

      are less likely to vote. They are less likely to trust in established institutions,
      whether it's the government, or groups like AMA. Many feel disenfranchised,
      from politics that don't represent them, from schools that cost too much and
      deliver too little, and from political activist that give lofty speeches about
      police brutality, while surrounded by police escorts, then pack up and leave
      after an hour.\n                                                        </p>"

    - Franklin Constitution Team Takes Fifth at State
    - ''
    - The Franklin Maroon constitution team competed on Saturday, January 17 at the
      We the People state competition held at the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse
      in downtown Portland. Each unit participated in two mock congressional hearings
      before volunteer judges. Franklin placed fifth of the six teams that made it
      to state, with Grant taking first and advancing to the national competition,
      and Lincoln taking second.

      I speak for all of us when I say we were just happy to have gotten the experience,\"
      said Grayson Perez (12), a member of Unit 1, which focuses on the philosophical
      foundations of the American political system. \"We are all happy that we do
      not have to… work for three more months, but we all wish we had gotten a little
      bit farther.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tIn an early survey taken in the class,
      the majority of Franklin AP Government students preferred that the team be split
      into JV and varsity. However, most of the students also assumed that they would
      be varsity competitors, so the decision was made to make the two teams equal.
      Some Franklin competitors wished that the team had been more selective and competitive,
      rather than emphasizing inclusiveness. At Grant and Lincoln, the only two schools
      to have won the Oregon State Competition since its inception in 1987, students
      must apply for the team, and 36 students are selected based on their essays,
      interviews, commitment, and academic standing. This process has produced some
      high achieving teams; Lincoln won the national title in 2012 and 2014, and Grant
      won in 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tCompeting at the State level, however, is
      nothing to be scoffed at. Franklin's team placed third at the state competition
      last year, which was the highest Franklin had placed since it began sending
      teams to the competition in 2004. Students face esteemed judges, many of whom
      are actual judges, elected officials, attorneys, or other prominent figures.
      Justice Tom Balmer told Franklin's Unit 1, \"In ten years, when you are all
      leaders in this community, I hope you tell your friends, 'You know what, I held
      my own against the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.'\" Other judges
      heaped praise upon Franklin students.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \t\"I thought the

      November, Grant Magazine (Grant High School's student publication) <a href='http://grantmagazine.com/marshall/'>published
      an article</a> detailing concerns with their school's temporary move to Marshall
      in September 2017. Reporters found that moving Grant to the Marshall Campus
      was inconsistent with the PPS Racial Educational Equity Policy, as historically
      underserved populations of students would be disproportionately adversely affected.
      PPS, they claim, did not seriously consider moving Grant to Jefferson rather
      than Marshall. This option would have reduced the impact of the transition on
      disadvantaged students in the Grant attendance area, which tend to live farther
      from Marshall and have the fewest options for getting to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      and U.S. Census data</a> show that many of the school's economically disadvantaged
      and underserved students live closer to Marshall than to Franklin, so the move
      is not likely to raise equity concerns. The close proximity of Marshall and
      Franklin also makes the move a less drastic change for most Franklin students.\n</p>\n"

      no dedicated space for pedestrians on the block between 92nd Avenue and the
      campus, but PPS is negotiating with the Portland Bureau of Transportation to
      create a safer environment on this street. There will be no additional yellow
      bus service to transport students to the campus, so many students will rely
      on walking, biking, or TriMet to get to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tIn
      November, Grant Magazine (Grant High School's student publication) <a href='http://grantmagazine.com/marshall/'>published
      an article</a> detailing concerns with their school's temporary move to Marshall
      in September 2017. Reporters found that moving Grant to the Marshall Campus
      was inconsistent with the PPS Racial Educational Equity Policy, as historically
      underserved populations of students would be disproportionately adversely affected.
      PPS, they claim, did not seriously consider moving Grant to Jefferson rather
      than Marshall. This option would have reduced the impact of the transition on
      disadvantaged students in the Grant attendance area, which tend to live farther
      from Marshall and have the fewest options for getting to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      Franklin, however, <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8g4MqH4-OKV0VwOHZ0b29qOUE/view?usp=sharing'>PPS
      and U.S. Census data</a> show that many of the school's economically disadvantaged
      and underserved students live closer to Marshall than to Franklin, so the move
      is not likely to raise equity concerns. The close proximity of Marshall and
      Franklin also makes the move a less drastic change for most Franklin students.\n</p>\n"

      that could run on solar energy. After 10 years, that aircraft was unveiled,
      Solar Impulse 1 Prototype HB-SIA. The plane has a wingspan of 208 ft. It has
      very minimal weight compared to the average weight of a car, weighing about
      3,527 pounds. The horsepower of the plane is about 1000 watts. In 2010, the
      aircraft went into professional flight tests to examine the plane's flight envelope,
      and did night flights to guarantee, it can function at night. During the flight,
      three world records were established specifically for Solar Impulse 1. Maximum
      altitude (9,235 meters), maximum duration (26h10m19s) and gain in altitude (8,744
      meters). By September in 2010, Solar Impulse's prototype landed at the international
      airports of Geneva and Zurich. Solar Impulse has established challenges for
      the Solar Impulse aircrafts. For flight training, they plan on making a flight
      simulator for the aircraft. This will give pilots the opportunity to train for
      long duration missions and practice the delicate handling of their aircraft.
      They are also developing a monitoring system for the plane, that constantly
      checks the functioning of an autopilot system and provides detection of safety
      limits. As for staff in Solar Impulse, partial leadership was handed to a man
      named Andre Borschberg. Andre Borschberg is the co-founder of Solar Impulse.
      He is also the man who did many flight tests for Solar Impulse planes and was
      responsible for completing a 24-hour flight for Solar Impulse Prototypes. Bertrand
      Piccard is a Swiss psychiatrist and balloonist. He is a pilot and the chairman
      of Solar Impulse who is currently working with others on the Mission Control
      Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSolar Impulse 2 will be participating in Solar Impulse's
      First Round-The-World flight. It will take-off from Abu Dhabi, capital of the
      United Arab Emirate, in late February or early March. The plane will return
      to it's starting location in late July or early August. Currently Solar Impulse
      is focusing on their Mission Control Center. After that Solar Impulse will focus
      on the Round-The-World flight.\n</p>"

      altitude (9,235 meters), maximum duration (26h10m19s) and gain in altitude (8,744
      meters). By September in 2010, Solar Impulse's prototype landed at the international
      airports of Geneva and Zurich. Solar Impulse has established challenges for
      the Solar Impulse aircrafts. For flight training, they plan on making a flight
      simulator for the aircraft. This will give pilots the opportunity to train for
      long duration missions and practice the delicate handling of their aircraft.
      They are also developing a monitoring system for the plane, that constantly
      checks the functioning of an autopilot system and provides detection of safety
      limits. As for staff in Solar Impulse, partial leadership was handed to a man
      named Andre Borschberg. Andre Borschberg is the co-founder of Solar Impulse.
      He is also the man who did many flight tests for Solar Impulse planes and was
      responsible for completing a 24-hour flight for Solar Impulse Prototypes. Bertrand
      Piccard is a Swiss psychiatrist and balloonist. He is a pilot and the chairman
      of Solar Impulse who is currently working with others on the Mission Control
      Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSolar Impulse 2 will be participating in Solar Impulse's
      First Round-The-World flight. It will take-off from Abu Dhabi, capital of the
      United Arab Emirate, in late February or early March. The plane will return
      to it's starting location in late July or early August. Currently Solar Impulse
      is focusing on their Mission Control Center. After that Solar Impulse will focus
      on the Round-The-World flight.\n</p>"

    - The Raven Boys Review
    - '"A wild and extremely distressing journey"'
    - 'Upon reading the summary of <em>The Raven Boys</em> by Maggie Stiefvater, your
      first thought will be: "Oh god, another Young Adult book where a girl''s entire
      life hinges around a boy. I''m already bored." But hold on, dear reader, because
      the back of this book is an utter lie. The misleading and vaguely yawn-worthy
      synopsis of <em>The Raven Boys</em> barely scratches the surface of this wild
      and extremely distressing journey.'
    - "<p>\n\tUpon reading the summary of <em>The Raven Boys</em> by Maggie Stiefvater,

      because the back of this book is an utter lie. The misleading and vaguely yawn-worthy
      synopsis of <em>The Raven Boys</em> barely scratches the surface of this wild
      and extremely distressing journey.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, here's the breakdown: At
      its most basic level, this book is about one girl and four boys and their beautiful,
      wonderful, heartbreaking friendship. It is also about magic, clairvoyant women,
      trees that speak Latin, and a dead Welsh king named Glendower.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe
      story begins with one girl: Blue Sargent. Blue Sargent has grown up in a house
      literally filled to the brim with women psychics, and ever since she was little,
      these psychics have all agreed upon one thing: if Blue is to kiss her true love,
      he will die.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis burden of knowledge has never raised any problems
      for Blue until, one chilly and genre-appropriately spooky night, our heroine
      sees her first spirit-- a boy who is going to be dead within the next twelve
      months. This soon-to-be-dead spirit wears the uniform of a local boys' private
      academy, and his only communication with Blue is his name: Gansey. The only
      reason Blue would see a spirit on that particular night is if he's her true
      love, or if she killed him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe plot thickens and goes ever onward
      from there. Blue becomes somehow entangled in a feverish search for Glendower,
      a long dead king, along with four boys who attend the rich private school: Gansey,
      who is unaware of his imminent demise; Ronan, who prefers punching to speaking;
      Adam, who attends his expensive school with a scholarship, three jobs, and impeccable
      grades; and Noah, who is quiet and mysterious.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, dear reader,
      the synopsis of <em>The Raven Boys</em> was misleading in one very important
      way: Blue was not a girl who was incomplete without a boy. These four boys were
      incomplete without her. She is the final piece to their puzzle; she is the one
      who begins the story. Well-written, hilarious, poignant, and, at times, absolutely
      breathtaking, <em>The Raven Boys</em> is one of the finest books that has come
      out in the past several years.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you would like to dip your toe
      into this series, you can grab <em>The Raven Boys</em>, <em>The Dream Thieves</em>,
      and <em>Blue Lily, Lily Blue</em> for your reading pleasure right now. The fourth
      and final book, <em>The Raven King</em>, is out in September.\n</p>"

    - Billionaire Announces plan for Global Internet
    - Could the internet reach Mars too?
    - When you look back at the history of the internet so far, some events jump out.
      The switch from broadband to fiber optics, the use of Wi-Fi, the emergence of
      huge companies like Google. If billionaire Elon Musk has anything to say about
      it, we may be able to add interplanetary internet to the list.

      originally made his fortune through the internet, inventing and then later selling
      services such as PayPal to accumulate wealth which he later put into building
      companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. He's hoping to dream even bigger now, announcing
      on January 16 that he wants to spend at least ten billion dollars to launch
      hundreds of satellites into space to spread high speed internet throughout the
      planet and beyond.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis isn't the first news of Musk's interest
      in cheap internet for the masses via satellite, as he discussed in mid-November
      of last year, when he hinted at the company's plan in a tweet. At first many
      laughed the plan off as just another crazy idea for the spreading of the internet,
      yet Musk once again brought it up on January 16. This time the announcement
      was in a formal setting, during an event in Seattle for SpaceX.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMusk
      stated that he wants to bring the internet to areas with few people for as low
      of a cost as possible. One of the best parts of using satellites for internet
      according to Musk is not having to worry about wires. \"The speed of light is
      40 percent faster in the vacuum of space than it is for fiber. The long-term
      potential is to be the primary means of long-distance Internet traffic and to
      serve people in sparsely populated areas,\" said Musk.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAny plan
      by Musk just wouldn't seem right unless there was a distant goal, and that's
      where Mars comes in. \"It will be important for Mars to have a global communications
      network as well,\" Musk said during the event. \"I think this needs to be done,
      and I don't see anyone else doing it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe project is expected
      to cost anywhere from ten to fifteen billion dollars and could end up employing
      more than 1000 people. To begin with though, Musk has assigned 60 people to
      work on the project which currently has not been named. He expects the project
      to take at least 12 to 15 years to spread the network across the planet, although
      it will likely take much longer for internet to reach Mars due to the nature
      of the project.\n</p>"

      extremely generous with toppings. Not only that, but the bread roll used was
      huge, and ended up being enough for two meals- well worth the $6.50. A friend

      alleyway; earth-tone houses with high open windows and no doors or spaces between
      them, a continuous wall with no one behind it. No clouds in the vivid sky, so
      open in contrast to my imprisonment. The alley curves and I notice I'm running,
      my bare feet smacking the stones in 4/4 time is the only sound. Then I stop.
      The walls have turned to stone like the street, but there is now a break in
      the wall: an inviting archway with sunlight pouring out in a shifting yellowish
      reflection. I creep up to the entryway, curious but suspicious. There are four
      rough, salt-colored stone steps immediately downward before they disappear into
      the most beautiful body of water to ever exist. <em>It must be for goddesses</em>,
      I think, because nothing this remarkable could ever be here for an earthly creature.
      And yet it feels necessary for me to delve in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThis pool is not large, no bigger than the average bedroom. There
      are no windows looking in, and delicate vines, mosses, succulents, and flowers
      cling to the stone walls. A warm wind blows ripples across its surface and I
      inhale the scent of oceans and fresh bread and cherry blossoms. The azure water,
      while appearingly transparent, cannot be seen through, as I've stepped down
      to the water's edge at some point and my feet are lost below. Somehow I'm aware
      that this oasis is very deep, very salty, and very good, <em>oh such a good,
      perfect place to be, that I think I should float for some time…</em> In the
      depths of my mind I remember that the Dead Sea's salt content is high enough
      that a person can lay back effortlessly and be caressed by the water. I take
      a few more faithful steps down, again mysteriously knowing stairs will be where
      my feet go, until I'm up to my knees in the warm… <em>sea. This must be some
      kind of sea…</em> The hem of my ivory sundress with its delicate blue embroidery
      drifts along the top of the water as I turn around. I begin to lay back, and
      am met by the sweet kisses of each water particle as I reach them. I close my
      eyes in content love for this place, myself, the empty sky above, for the little
      pink flowers and bees, and not another soul exists in this world.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tI'm seeing myself now, from above, and I am something
      out of a dream. My dress and hair are splayed out like rays of sunshine in that
      soft, motherly water. The body I'm seeing myself from is drifting, further away
      from the physical form, so appeased with her closed eyes and blossoming mind.

    - 'Are you a fantasy fan, or just looking for something new? You might enjoy Robin
      McKinley''s <em>Shadows</em>, which follows 17 year old Maggie, who lives in
      a world which is divided into three main regions: Oldworld, Newworld and Farworld,
      corresponding to Europe, North America and Asia.'
    - "<p>\n\tAre you a fantasy fan, or just looking for something new? You might
      enjoy Robin McKinley's <em>Shadows</em>, which follows 17 year old Maggie, who
      lives in a world which is divided into three main regions: Oldworld, Newworld
      and Farworld, corresponding to Europe, North America and Asia.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t
      Magic is outlawed in both Newworld and Farworld; the government has focused
      on science, and the magic gene no longer exists within the populous. Magic is
      still born in the people of Oldworld, which practices magic. Maggie has nothing
      to do with magic until her mom marries Val, a stranger from Oldworld. Maggie
      notices strange behavior in Val and observes that it's \"like there [is] more
      than just Val there…I noticed there was something wrong with the darkness… It
      was the shadows…\" (7).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <em>Shadows</em>, McKinley creates
      an interesting niche in the fantasy genre by blending sci-fi, magic and dystopia.
      Newworld is an authoritarian society where the government will persecute you
      just for using \"a charm to cure warts or make hair grow\" (13). Sci-fi is incorporated
      by McKinley's invention of industries like NIDL- a government agency that deals
      with magical events or her invention of a scientific procedure- the removal
      of the magic gene. It is also shown by her invention of technology- armydar
      is radar run by the army that prevents magical events. In the book, sci-fi and
      dystopia blend together to create a believable society, while magic acts as
      the catalyst for adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother reason that this book is worth
      a read are the interactions between Maggie and Val. Over the course of the book,
      their relationship evolves from one of deep hatred to one of respect and understanding.
      At first, Maggie hates Val because of the many eerie shadows that follow him
      around. She is terrified that he is secretly an evil magician, come to destroy
      her family. However, as she gradually gets to know him better, and after Val
      saves one of her friends, he gains Maggie's respect. The best thing about the
      change is that it is gradual, and feels realistic. If you want to read a book
      with a blend of sci-fi, dystopia and fiction, and that has good character relationships,
      then <em>Shadows </em>is for you.\n</p>"

      seasons in recent history for the team. You probably heard about it: one of
      the best starts in team history and multiple All-Stars, finally culminated in

      season, it hasn't been nearly as easy for the team to stay healthy, and the
      trainers have had no shortage of work. When the injuries started, they just
      kept coming.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tOne of the key contributes
      to Blazers' success in recent seasons has been small forward Nicolas Batum.
      Batum came into this season following a rocky divorce and his problems didn't
      stop there. It was just a few weeks into the season, on a November 9 game against
      the Denver Nuggets, when Batum fell and bruised his knee. He wasn't out for
      long, but Batum suffered an injury to his wrist just a month later, against
      Milwaukee. The injury was simply labeled as wrist soreness, and Batum gritted
      his teeth and played through it. He announced a month later that he had actually
      torn a ligament in his wrist but continued to play, refusing to shut himself
      down to recuperate. Overall, Batum's injuries have resulted in a drop of production
      for a player that had seemed to be an emerging star in the NBA.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                                \tOne
      of the other starters for Portland, All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldridge
      has not been the epitome of health either. Arguably the most important player
      on the team, Aldridge missed a few games early in the season due to a chest
      cold. Then on January 19, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Aldridge injured
      his left thumb while attempting to block a shot by DeMarcus Cousins. After sitting
      out for a pair of games, it was announced that Aldridge would forego surgery
      on his thumb indefinitely, a decision that will shape the Blazers' fortunes
      for the rest of the season.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tAnother frontcourt player
      for the Blazers, Robin Lopez, has missed 26 games this year after not missing
      a single game for the previous two seasons. Lopez, like Batum and Aldridge,
      was a major factor in the team's success last year, but after breaking his right
      hand on December 16 the six year center out of Stanford missed a lengthy stretch
      of games. Between Lopez's injury and backup center Joel Freeland's shoulder
      sprain on January 5, the team was lacking in the height department for over
      a month. Lopez eventually returned on February 3, but Freeland isn't expected
      to return until late into February.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                                \tBlazer
      fans are more than aware of the danger that injuries pose to the team, especially
      in a season in which the Western conference is as competitive as it is. Fan
      Emmett Allen (10) understands the importance of a healthy roster. \"The Blazers
      started out really strong, but it's difficult to keep up that kind of production
      with so many injuries to key players,\" said Allen. \"It's going to be exciting
      to see what they can do with Lopez back as long as everyone else stays healthy.\"
      As many coaches will tell you, the season's not over until the final game is
      played, and with just over half the season gone there is still quite a bit of
      time for the Blazers' fortunes to get better, or much worse.\n                                </p>"

    - Preparation Begins For Women's World Cup 2015
    - ''
    - Walking out into the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, hearing the roar of
      90,000 people, and winning the game in a penalty kick shootout is arguably one
      of the most defining and dramatic moments in the USA's soccer history. This
      was at the 1999 Women's World Cup, which was the last time the United States
      won.

      the roar of 90,000 people, and winning the game in a penalty kick shootout is
      arguably one of the most defining and dramatic moments in the USA's soccer history.
      This was at the 1999 Women's World Cup, which was the last time the United States
      won.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe USA came close to winning again
      at the last World Cup in 2011. The US team lost to Japan in the final, and they
      want revenge. The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup will take place from June 6 to
      July 5 in Canada, with the opening game in Edmonton. Qualifications have finished
      and the groups have been selected as the opening game draws near.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tIn a lottery last year on December 6 competition groups
      consisting of four teams that will make up the USA's first three games were
      selected. A good or bad group can change a team's progression in the tournament.
      Last world cup, the USA men's national team were placed in the group dubbed
      the \"Group of Death\" because it was so difficult. The women feel like they
      are going have it just is hard this year because they have three teams in the
      top ten FIFA rankings, including Sweden, who they lost to 2-1 in group stages
      last World Cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t\"It's a good group to
      get us ready to play,\" Jill Ellis, U.S.A Women's coach, said to ussoccer.com.
      \"Physically it's a demanding group, but we've got a lot of depth on our roster
      and we'll be able to manage against some good teams with some good challenges.
      It's probably the toughest group. That's historically been the path the USA
      has taken, and we're obviously going to embrace it.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tEven though their group is challenging, the US must step up in order
      to call themselves the best team in the world. They will also have to deal with
      FIFA's refusal to put down real grass at the world cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tAdditionally, a lawsuit that was filed last fall against FIFA with
      the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario was just dropped as of January 21. Some
      of the best players in the world including Brazil's Marta and the USA's Alex
      Morgan and Abby Wambach were furious that FIFA refused to put down actual grass
      for the women's World Cup, opting for artificial turf for all of the stadiums.
      The players felt that turf has a completely different playing style and it leaves
      them more prone to injury. Some players have viewed this as gender discrimination
      and claim that the men's World Cup would never be played on turf as many players
      would refuse to participate.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOn January

      \       \tThis World Cup hasn't been unfolding without controversy, but the

    - "<p>\n        \tWalking out into the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, hearing
      the roar of 90,000 people, and winning the game in a penalty kick shootout is
      arguably one of the most defining and dramatic moments in the USA's soccer history.
      This was at the 1999 Women's World Cup, which was the last time the United States
      won.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe USA came close to winning again
      at the last World Cup in 2011. The US team lost to Japan in the final, and they
      want revenge. The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup will take place from June 6 to
      July 5 in Canada, with the opening game in Edmonton. Qualifications have finished
      and the groups have been selected as the opening game draws near.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tIn a lottery last year on December 6 competition groups
      consisting of four teams that will make up the USA's first three games were
      selected. A good or bad group can change a team's progression in the tournament.
      Last world cup, the USA men's national team were placed in the group dubbed
      the \"Group of Death\" because it was so difficult. The women feel like they
      are going have it just is hard this year because they have three teams in the
      top ten FIFA rankings, including Sweden, who they lost to 2-1 in group stages
      last World Cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t\"It's a good group to
      get us ready to play,\" Jill Ellis, U.S.A Women's coach, said to ussoccer.com.
      \"Physically it's a demanding group, but we've got a lot of depth on our roster
      and we'll be able to manage against some good teams with some good challenges.
      It's probably the toughest group. That's historically been the path the USA
      has taken, and we're obviously going to embrace it.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tEven though their group is challenging, the US must step up in order
      to call themselves the best team in the world. They will also have to deal with
      FIFA's refusal to put down real grass at the world cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tAdditionally, a lawsuit that was filed last fall against FIFA with
      the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario was just dropped as of January 21. Some
      of the best players in the world including Brazil's Marta and the USA's Alex
      Morgan and Abby Wambach were furious that FIFA refused to put down actual grass
      for the women's World Cup, opting for artificial turf for all of the stadiums.
      The players felt that turf has a completely different playing style and it leaves
      them more prone to injury. Some players have viewed this as gender discrimination
      and claim that the men's World Cup would never be played on turf as many players
      would refuse to participate.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOn January
      22, Wambach released a statement saying, \"I am hopeful that the players' willingness
      to contest the unequal playing fields — and the tremendous public support we
      received during the effort — marks the start of even greater activism to ensure

    - "<p>\n        \tSince last December, there have been a total of 121 cases of
      measles in the United States. The outbreak, traced back to an infected child

      This is due to opposition to vaccinations for religious reasons or fear of dangerous
      side-effects. These concerns often prevent people from vaccinating themselves
      or their children. These \"anti-vaxxers\" are quick to debate about the harmful
      effects vaccinations can cause, ranging from blood poisoning to developing autism.
      The problem with this argument, however, is that these correlations have been
      proven false numerous times, all by sources such as the Institute of Medicine.

      is that, besides the fact the chemicals in vaccinations are \"dangerous\", it
      is healthy to expose children to viruses in order to boost their immune system
      naturally. They argue that since viruses appear naturally and vaccines are man-made,
      it would be better for a child to contract the virus and suffer through the
      disease. These people, especially the parents at the heart of the anti-vaccine
      movement, are being blamed as spreaders and incubators of diseases that are
      entirely preventable.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tAccording to the
      New York Times, one anti-vax mother simply said that there was \"absolutely
      no reason to get the shot.\" When her 16-year-old daughter was sent home for
      two weeks due to being unvaccinated and vulnerable to measles, she requested
      to get the required shots. Her mother replied with, \"I'd rather you miss an
      entire semester than you get the shot.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tAnti-vaxxers
      aren't the only ones being called negligent; the argument is going both sides.

      vaccines. You didn't ask about the chemicals in them.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThe scrutiny from both sides about the safety of human life has always

    - Multicultural Week
    - What is it?
    - Multicultural Awareness week is a new annual event for FHS. It is a week for
      students to be educated about the Franklin High School community, and for students
      to celebrate and express their culture to the school.

      the week of February 9, Franklin High School clubs including German Club, Russian
      Club, Vietnamese Club, and many more shared details, information, and activities
      related to their culture. For example, the Black Student Union (BSU) communicated
      facts about Africa. Domingo Urrutia also shared his feelings about of what multicultural

    - 
    - Told almost exclusively backstage in a broadway playhouse, <i>Birdman, or The

      trying to make a comeback by producing, directing, and starring in the play
      of a Raymond Carver short story.<i> </i>

      play of a Raymond Carver short story.<i> </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe story takes
      place in the course of the three days leading up to opening night. Played by
      Michael Keaton, the main character Riggan Thomson is also trying to reconnect
      with his estranged daughter (Emma Stone) and in some scenes it appears he struggles
      with undiagnosed schizophrenia and hallucinations. As if this isn't enough of
      a plot, the film also delves into the personal dilemmas of other actors working
      on the play.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not difficult to see how the director, Alejandro
      Gonzalez Innaritu, won three Academy Awards for his work on <i>Birdman. </i>One
      of the unique aspects of the film was how long the scenes were. Often the camera
      would follow a character all the way around a building, or across the stage.
      This made the movie seem less like a compilation of scenes that had been put
      together and more like it was just someone's life the viewer was observing.
      Although this style sometimes made it hard to follow, it also gave a distinct
      perspective on the story that other movies do not typically show.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn
      some scenes of the film, it was unclear whether what was happening was reality
      or a hallucination, and I think the intention of this was to have a window into
      what it's like to live with a mental disability such as schizophrenia. This
      made for an ambiguous but still satisfying ending. At the same time, Riggan's
      disorder was not the main focus of the story, which distinguished it from other
      movies because it showed that although Riggan struggled with his illness, it
      didn't dominate his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOverall, I would recommend <i>Birdman</i>
      because although the majority of the scenes were dialogue, they were very engaging
      through the whole course of the film. I believe that it earned Best Picture
      because of its unique plot, skilled actors, and talented director.\n</p>"

      all of seven minutes to be seated, order, and receive two hot, delicious full
      meals of Huevos Rancheros, and a bacon omelette with potatoes O'Brien and sourdough
      toast. We went on a Sunday morning at about 10 o'clock, which is arguably one
      of the most popular times to go out to breakfast in Southeast Portland. The

      and people watching, a family with an infant who was toddling around on the
      table, and two middle-aged men playing a game of cards while finishing up breakfast.
      One man finished up his breakfast, and then realized he left his wallet at home.
      He asked the waitress if he could run home and come back to pay. The waiter
      called him a “regular” and expressed that she trusted him to return. The slightly
      worn in chairs, friendly servers, and 80's music playing in the background gave
      the joint a uniquely homey feel.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tItems on the breakfast menu range
      from $4.50 to $12.25, and sides range from $.50 to $3.75. They also allow call
      in orders which can be perfect for a late night snack, fuel for conquering Hawthorne,
      or a special treat during a late arrival. At just under a mile away from the
      Franklin campus, Genie's Too could even be a lunch spot for students with cars.\n</p>"

    - "<i>A Community on the Move</i> is a captivating exhibit about the courage and
      persistence of Portland's black residents in the 1940s and early 1950s. The
      exhibit will engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds as it traces the WWII
      shipyards, migration from the South, the Vanport flood, and how urban renewal
      projects affected Portland's black families and businesses. One of the interactive
      displays shows what a reading corner in a house in the 1940's would look like.
      Another had a treasure chest that showed clothing and accessories that were
      popular in that time period."

      with a newspaper from the 1940's and also a common food menu one would find
      at a restaurant. The exhibit includes drawings of racist caricatures on products
      like milk cartons. . The racist remarks would go unnoticed by some in the 1940's.
      The exhibit captured both how far we have come, and how far we still have to
      go.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother aspect of the exhibit was the Vanport Flood. African
      Americans had to deal with the repercussions of the flood. There was a lot of
      things that were out of their control, and they had little amount of help regrouping.
      They were not asked if they wanted to move out of the area, but told to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe
      exhibit also explored jobs. There were only select jobs that African Americans
      could get. This was a reminder that African Americans face a lot of barriers
      because systemic racism still exists. The exhibit also investigates urban renewal.
      The urban renewal is redistributing the population in a certain area. Urban
      renewal continues to happen in Portland today. “The landscape continues to change\"

      an insight into Portland's past, and the level of racism that existed. It gives

    - Drivers Ed at PCC
    - 
    - Students ages fifteen to seventeen who take Portland Community College's (PCC)
      Drivers Education course and pass it (with an eighty percent or more) no longer
      have to take Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT)'s drive test at the
      DMV to get a Class C Provisional License. This license is for people ages sixteen
      to seventeen and has several restrictions including the time they drive and
      who they drive with. The price ($9) for taking the driver's test is waived.
      However, the cost of the course for an unlicensed teen is $300, and $495 for
      an unlicensed adult. Many teens who take Drivers Ed receive a discount on insurance.
      Although students who have passed the course don't have to take the driving
      test, they do have to take a knowledge test.

    - Woodblock Chocolate
    - 
    - About four years ago, Charley Wheelock and his wife Jessica Wheelock learned
      the difference between a chocolatier and a chocolate maker. They discovered
      there were no chocolate makers in Portland making it all the way from the bean
      to the bar.

      learned the difference between a chocolatier and a chocolate maker. They discovered
      there were no chocolate makers in Portland making it all the way from the bean
      to the bar.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“See over here, cacao beans, this is what differentiates
      us from chocolatiers,” says Wheelock. “Moonstruck never sees a cacao bean.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter
      buying a 100 year old roaster from a 95 year-old, self-proclaimed “peanut master”,
      the Wheelocks began to make and produce chocolate with only two ingredients:
      chocolate and sugar. They named their company Woodblock Chocolate. As their
      business blossomed from a basement experiment to a full-fledged manufactory
      over four years, Portland gave birth to nine other chocolate manufacturers.
      Woodblock Chocolate now has comrades in the business and a bit of friendly competition.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Some
      of 'em I'm friendly with, some of 'em we're like enemies; it's fun, it's good,
      it keeps everybody honest. Especially because I know my chocolate blows all
      their chocolate away,” Wheelock laughs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWoodblock Chocolate currently
      imports beans from Trinidad, Ecuador, Peru, and Madagascar. Charley personally
      has been to Peru, Trinidad, and Costa Rica to pick up beans and inspect their
      processing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Because our chocolate is just two ingredients, cacao
      beans and sugar, there is nowhere to hide, we have to have really good cacao
      beans, like a wine maker looks at a grape, we are looking at a cacao bean so
      we try to find good cacao,” explains Wheelock.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Woodblock
      gets the beans, they have been fermented and dried. “That's a process,” Wheelock
      explains, “that's where the flavor starts to develop, not only do you have to
      have cacao with good genetics but you have to have to find farmers or a co-op
      who's willing make adjustments in their fermentation and drying to elevate the
      potential of the cacao.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough it is a small company, Woodblock
      Chocolate makes its way all over the country. Wheelock even comments that some
      of their chocolate made it to Sweden and Japan this year. Many local buyers
      also favor Woodblock Chocolate. Famous local ice cream shop Salt and Straw featured
      a Woodblock Chocolate flavored ice cream this year. Charley leaves Portlanders
      with the message that they live in a wonderful place to love chocolate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“[Portlanders]
      are super fortunate to be living in a town where they have such a progressive
      chocolate scene. Because with all these chocolate makers, there's all this awesome
      new chocolate, and it's really becoming the cutting edge.”\n</p>"

    - Corporations Able to Purchase Land on the Moon?
    - 
    - A recent report, suggests that future territory on the moon may be available
      for purchase and usability for major corporations. Reuters recently obtained
      a letter by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which reveals that the
      FAA plans to "leverage the FAA's existing launch licensing authority to encourage
      private sector investments in space systems by ensuring that commercial activities
      can be conducted on a non-interference basis,” which opens up licensing for
      corporations to obtain lunar territory.

      nations have the right to go up and take lunar materials such as lunar soil,
      but nations can not claim any part of the moon for themselves. A corporation,
      however, is not a nation, so the treaty doesn't apply to them. Almost anyone,
      right now, can buy a deed for the moon from The Lunar Registry also known as
      the Lunar Real-Estate Agency. They sell deeds on their website for about 20$
      an acre, but another Moon Treaty is necessary to recognize and enforce property
      rights. Others have a different opinion on lunar ownership, such as Bigelow
      Aerospace, a developer of space stations. Bigelow told Reuters that the FAA's
      letter doesn't necessarily mean that there can be ownership of the moon, it
      just means somebody else isn't licensed or allowed to go on land where someone
      else is in the process of exploration.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is uncertain when major
      corporations will plan to expand to the moon, as most corporations don't share

    - Insufficient Field Space at Marshall
    - 
    - The move to Marshall is already beginning, and while the campus has already
      been renamed with a sign deeming it "Franklin High School," there is still at
      least one unsolved problem. The sports teams, particularly the football and
      soccer teams, do not have enough field space at the Marshall campus for the
      teams to practice their respective sports.

      as much of a home field advantage. Also, if students have to practice at a different

    - Oklahoma Bill to Ban APUSH is a Huge Mistake
    - 
    - 'As of Feb. 17, 2015, the Advanced Placement United States History class (APUSH)
      is banned in Oklahoma because a legislative committee declared that Oklahoma
      public schools are forbidden to set aside money for the class. The reason: the
      Republican state representative who introduced the bill, Dan Fisher, believes
      that APUSH shows too much of "what is bad about America" and not enough “American
      exceptionalism,” as quoted in TalkingPointsMemo.com. As an APUSH student myself,
      this motion to censor American history seems ridiculous, and frankly, disturbing.
      America- like every other country on the Earth- is not perfect. To try and change
      that truth is like trying to hide an elephant under a handkerchief. As George
      Santayana famously said, “those who do not learn history are bound to repeat
      it.”'

      under a handkerchief. As George Santayana famously said, “those who do not learn
      history are bound to repeat it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe're already forgetting our
      history. On June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court dismantled section four of the
      Voting Rights Act (VRA). The VRA was fought for by African Americans in the
      1960s. The two sections affected by the court's ruling are Sections four and
      five. Section four of the VRA ruled that states and other areas that have histories
      of racist and discriminatory voting laws have to get pre- approval before redistricting
      or changing voting laws. Section five of the VRA stops changes in voting laws
      or in redistricting until a judge, the attorney general or a lawsuit find them
      to not be discriminatory. Dismantling this law it means that effectively allows
      states to change their voting rules and make them more discriminatory; many
      feel that in modern times, we don't need such stringent voting rights protection.
      Clearly we are forgetting the purpose of the act: to make sure minorities and
      the oppressed will always have equal voting rights.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead of
      trying to hide or censor our history, we need to acknowledge it and teach it.
      If we discuss our past and admit that America and American citizens did horrible
      things, we can move past mistakes and not repeat them. Every student has the
      right to learn and how can students form well-rounded, factual opinions without
      the full story? These students are the teachers, historians, journalists and
      judges, legislators and lawyers, mayors and governors, secretaries of state
      or maybe even presidents of our future. If the leaders of our country do not
      know the whole truth, how would they be able to vote, write laws, run a city
      or state, let alone a country?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, Oklahoma is not
      alone. Texas has also made motions to ban APUSH. As in Oklahoma, some complain
      about the College Board curriculum. Stanley Kurtz, a conservative commentator,
      as quoted in “Texas moves to veto AP history course,” by <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/person/michele-richinick\">Michele
      Richinick</a>, for msnbc.com believes that its “origins... are closely tied
      to a movement of left-leaning historians that aims to 'internationalize' the
      teaching of American history. The goal is to 'end American history as we have
      known it' by substituting a more 'transnational' narrative for the traditional
      account.” True, some historians may be “left-leaning,” but that does not mean
      they aren't telling the truth. America is a country of immigrants, from the
      very beginning. The pilgrims certainly weren't natives. After we became Americans,
      there were still millions of immigrants who came to this country and became
      citizens. Poles, Italians, Jews, Irish, Germans, Mexicans, Russians, Chinese
      and Japanese, all made vast contributions to our education, economy, and infrastructure.
      True, American history can be negative, and APUSH can sometimes show a darker
      side of it, but APUSH also shows just how much we have been able to achieve
      despite how poorly immigrants, African Americans and other minorities or other
      disadvantaged people were treated.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Oklahoma legislature has
      made a gigantic mistake in banning APUSH. This act of censorship insults students'
      freedom to learn and damages the education of our future leaders. It also ignores
      the truth: that America is diverse, and has multiple viewpoints, which are taught
      in APUSH. American students have a right to know our full story, so we don't
      repeat the mistakes of the past, and so we can grow in the future.\n</p>"

    - Opting Out

      in the PPS District. While this testing is required by the state of Oregon,
      families have the option to opt out of the tests for reasons related to religion
      or disability. Changes in education often cause fear from parents and students
      alike. Luckily, fear of change is not a valid reason to opt out.

      are due to religion or disability, can opt out. Even if a student does not pass,
      there are alternate ways to easily meet the graduation requirement. Common Core
      and Smarter Balanced tests are a good hearted attempt at elevating education
      in the United States. There are many circumstances in life where these students
      will need to try their best and do something that is not as easy as they wish.\n</p>"

    - The iPhone 6 Plus, pictured here next to an HTC One M7, dwarfs most phones with
      its 5.5 inch screen while still maintaining Apple’s signature sense of style.
      Apple was only the most recent major phone manufacturer to increase the size
      of its flagship phones, following a trend that was originally put in motion
      in over four years ago towards larger mobile devices.

    - Franklin community members arrive to set up Discover Franklin. The event was
      held at the Marshall campus, where FHS will move for the next two school years.
      Marshall High School was closed in 2011, when the PPS School Board voted to
      consolidate high school students in SE Portland by relocating Marshall students
      to Franklin and Madison. Marshall is located on SE 91st Ave, about two miles
      east of Franklin.
