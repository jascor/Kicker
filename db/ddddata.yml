    - Why phones keep getting bigger
    - <p>Apple recently made headlines after selling four million phones in just one
      day, smashing their own previously-held record. In response to years of pressure
      from consumers and competitors alike, Apple announced two new phones in early
      September, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6+. Despite the lack of innovative features,
      a simple increase in the size of their line of flagship phones has allowed Apple
      to complete this impressive feat. The two phones showed a new path from one
      of the most famous technology companies in the world by considerably increasing
      the screen sizes of the phones.</p><p>This change is no surprise coming from
      Apple, considering just how many companies have beaten them to the punch. The
      first smartphone that proved a larger screen could lead to success was Motorola's
      Droid X in 2010. The Droid was the second highest selling phone of 2010, behind
      only the iPhone 4, while also having a then massive 4.3" display. Money talks,
      and the phone showed how effective a larger screen could be. Soon after, many
      other companies followed, resulting in an explosion in the market of big screen
      phones in 2011.</p><p>This expansion has grown exponentially since then, with
      phone screens now eclipsing 6 inches. This growth has been brought on by an
      overall positive reaction to larger screens. This is shown especially in foreign
      markets such as China, where over 20 percent of smartphones are over 5 inches
      in height. According to a report by Canalys, a market research and analysis
      firm, just this year, from Quarter One to Quarter Two, the market share for
      large screened phones has grown by 17% worldwide, showing the demand for larger
      phones is still increasing.</p><p>William Mclendon, a Psychology teacher at
      Franklin, explained why our society prefers these bigger screens. "People have
      been conditioned to like the idea of bigger is better." Mclendon's view of society's
      reaction to larger screens is interesting considering he was one of the first
      adopters of the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Apple, one of the largest technology companies
      in the world, responded to this idea by increasing the size of their flagship
      phone while also adding a new line of phones - the iPhone Six Plus. The Six
      Plus has a screen size of 5.5", .8 inches bigger than the iPhone 6, which also
      received a boost in size of .7 inches from the iPhone 5. This change shows a
      change in approach from Apple, whose anti-size approach has dominated markets
      for years.</p><p>As companies continue the arms race of who can hit the "sweet
      spot," it is equally important that companies do not overshoot and increase
      the screen size to a point where people feel uncomfortable using it. This is
      one of the biggest fears surrounding the Six Plus, as some early adopters have
      reported that the screen is simply too big, making the entire experience uncomfortable.
      Although the 6 Plus has received a cold reception in some instances, companies
      are still confident that the way to the consumer's heart is through the mentality
      of bigger is better. One thing is for sure though, as phones get larger and
      larger, the way we use mobile technology is continuing to change.</p>

John Kitzhaber will serve his fourth term as Governor of Oregon if reelected in November. The position has a limit of two consecutive four-year terms, but no cap on the total number of terms.

    - Swatting
    - Swatting is not only affecting celebrities
    - "<p>Imagine you’re playing a video game,blasting virtual opponents left and
      right, when you hear shouting. Soon, you’resurrounded by a SWAT, convinced you’re
      an armed killer. This situation hashappened - and not just once, but hundreds
      of times. “Swatting” is phoning afake emergency call to another person’s local
      police force, with the intentionof prompting a SWAT deployment to the victim’s
      home, for the purpose of scaringand disturbing the victim. Swatting has hit
      big time celebrities, Youtubepersonalities, and even political bloggers. Callers
      usually imitate the personwho is being swatted, informing the police that a
      violent crime has beencommitted by the person, and that they will perform another
      violent crime. Thepolice response is swift, armed, and ready to respond to a
      dangerous killer;what they usually find is a scared Twitch streamer, still broadcasting
      livefootage of police to hundreds or thousands of people.<o:p></o:p></p><p>A
      diverse range of celebrities likeClint Eastwood and Justin Bieber have been
      hit by the new dangerous pastime foronline bullies, but the majority of swatting
      calls focus on a small communityof Twitch and Youtube personalities that play
      games for the enjoyment of theirfans. Perpetrators have been known to gloat
      on social media, exalting in theattention they get and the disruption they cause.
      These pranksters have beenknown to gloat on social media, usually to taunt the
      victim. <o:p></o:p></p><p>The trend doesn’t seem to bestopping or slowing down.
      Police Captain Dave Hendrie commented that “A SWAT activation requiresnumerous
      personnel to respond to the scene in order to resolve it as safely aspossible.”
      The disregard for others’ wellbeing shows the fake calls tobe the product of
      extremely juvenile and petulant persons. <o:p></o:p></p><p>One famous swatter
      is MatthewWeigman, a blind American man sentenced to over 11 years in federal
      prison. Hewas able to imitate corporate employees, memorize numbers from the
      tones, andhe swatted people over sixty times. With the cost of each SWAT deployment
      costingthousands of dollars the story illustrates how people can disrupt the
      lawenforcement system. With the increasing armament and militarization of thepolice,
      and with the troubling developments in shooting like Ferguson, it’sonly a matter
      of time before this disruptive prank turns deadly.<o:p></o:p></p><p>As an exercise,
      imagine you are aSWAT officer. You’ve trained for months, this may even be your
      firstdeployment. You’ve heard stories of cops getting shot by armed men. Now
      you’rearmed with military grade weaponry, bullet proof vests, and are surrounded
      byfellow officers who are just as nervous and fearful as you. You are absolutelyconvinced

    - "<p>Imagine you’re playing a video game,blasting virtual opponents left and
      right, when you hear shouting. Soon, you’resurrounded by a SWAT, convinced you’re
      an armed killer. This situation hashappened - and not just once, but hundreds
      of times. “Swatting” is phoning afake emergency call to another person’s local
      police force, with the intentionof prompting a SWAT deployment to the victim’s
      home, for the purpose of scaringand disturbing the victim. Swatting has hit
      big time celebrities, Youtubepersonalities, and even political bloggers. Callers
      usually imitate the personwho is being swatted, informing the police that a
      violent crime has beencommitted by the person, and that they will perform another
      violent crime. Thepolice response is swift, armed, and ready to respond to a
      dangerous killer;what they usually find is a scared Twitch streamer, still broadcasting
      livefootage of police to hundreds or thousands of people.<o:p></o:p></p><p>A
      diverse range of celebrities likeClint Eastwood and Justin Bieber have been
      hit by the new dangerous pastime foronline bullies, but the majority of swatting
      calls focus on a small communityof Twitch and Youtube personalities that play
      games for the enjoyment of theirfans. Perpetrators have been known to gloat
      on social media, exalting in theattention they get and the disruption they cause.
      These pranksters have beenknown to gloat on social media, usually to taunt the
      victim. <o:p></o:p></p><p>The trend doesn’t seem to bestopping or slowing down.
      Police Captain Dave Hendrie commented that “A SWAT activation requiresnumerous
      personnel to respond to the scene in order to resolve it as safely aspossible.”
      The disregard for others’ wellbeing shows the fake calls tobe the product of
      extremely juvenile and petulant persons. <o:p></o:p></p><p>One famous swatter
      is MatthewWeigman, a blind American man sentenced to over 11 years in federal
      prison. Hewas able to imitate corporate employees, memorize numbers from the
      tones, andhe swatted people over sixty times. With the cost of each SWAT deployment
      costingthousands of dollars the story illustrates how people can disrupt the
      lawenforcement system. With the increasing armament and militarization of thepolice,
      and with the troubling developments in shooting like Ferguson, it’sonly a matter
      of time before this disruptive prank turns deadly.<o:p></o:p></p><p>As an exercise,
      imagine you are aSWAT officer. You’ve trained for months, this may even be your
      firstdeployment. You’ve heard stories of cops getting shot by armed men. Now
      you’rearmed with military grade weaponry, bullet proof vests, and are surrounded
      byfellow officers who are just as nervous and fearful as you. You are absolutelyconvinced
      that you are about to face an armed killer. As you enter the house,you see something
      out of the corner of your eye. It looks like a man carrying agun. Do you fire,
      potentially saving your life and your peers’ lives? Or do younot, practicing
      prudence? Can you, the reader, trust that a SWAT member wouldmake the right
      decision in a fake swatting incident? How many times does thisexact event have

    - Sushi Ichiban lives up to its name
    - Ichiban means "number one"
    - <p>Sushi Ichiban is a Japanese restaurant featuring a whimsical toy train which
      shuttles scrumptious plates around its sushi bar. It is located in downtown
      Portland at 24 NW Broadway, and it caters to customers for lunch and dinner.</p><p>The
      train selection includes maki, nigiri, salads, and desserts such as raspberry
      cheesecake. There's also the option to sit at a separate dining table instead
      of the sushi bar, as well as an extensive menu to order from.</p><p>When I walked
      into Sushi Ichiban at eight on a Saturday night, I easily found a spot at the
      sushi bar. I have been here before, closer to dinner time during the weekday,
      and had to wait around ten minutes for a spot. Although the restaurant gets
      fairly busy, it never takes very long to be seated. The service was speedy and
      welcoming, with a waitress coming over to take my beverage order within minutes.</p><p>I
      started by selecting salmon and tuna nigiri from the sushi train. Both pieces
      tasted very fresh and were still cold - always a good sign. Raw salmon has a
      light fishy taste and a slightly oily feel which was complimented perfectly
      by the vinegared rice. The tuna was more fishy but still tasted of good quality.</p><p>The
      best maki I ate was the specialty "Jo Roll", which consisted of a tuna roll
      with avocado and salmon on the outside, topped with flying fish eggs. It had
      a great texture and was perfectly salty without the need of soy sauce. The California
      roll was nothing special, featuring typical mock crab and avocado, but it was
      definitely fresher than its grocery store counterpart.</p><p>Following in the
      sushi bar tradition, Sushi Ichiban's dishes are placed on different colored
      plates, which represent the different prices. One of my favorite things about
      Sushi Ichiban is their Wednesday and Saturday discount, which reduces the prices
      of many of their more expensive plates to the white plate price, $1.25. This
      is a great deal for anyone who wants to load up on sushi without spending too
      much money.</p><p>Portland is home to many Japanese restaurants, but Sushi Ichiban
      is something special. It provides fun and affordability without sacrificing
      quality. For restaurant hours and more information, check out the Sushi Ichiban
      Facebook page.</p>

    - Feminism is the general belief in equality and that both genders should be treated
      equally. Recently, radical feminism has been perpetuated by many internet subcultures,
      which is a radicalized view of feminism believing that all women are oppressed
      by the patriarchy.

    - Diavolo Performance Review
    - A play by White Bird
    - <p>In 1997 Walter Jaffe and Paul King started a nonprofit organization devoted
      to bringing gifted groups of dancers to Portland. They named it White Bird,
      after their 25 year old cockatoo Barney. For the past 17 years White Bird has
      dedicated themselves to the "excellence of dance." The organization has brought
      203 dance companies to Portland, and works closely with public schools to reach
      around 5,000 students each year.</p><p>This weekend, White Bird presented Diavolo
      to its audience in the Newmark Theater. The show ran the 9th through the 11th.
      The L.A. based company made an appearance in Portland in earlier years and was
      elated to be back.</p><p>Lead by Artistic Director Jacques Heim (who calls his
      group Architecture in Motion), Diavolo is not a show to miss. Heim portrays
      the themes of human struggle, danger, and destiny in his work. "Coming to Portland
      is huge," said Heim. Diavolo should be at the top of anyone's "to see" list
      when it returns to Portland, complete with unforgettable props, and death defying
      feats. Diavolo featured a giant half moon prop by the world famous Michael Curry.
      Curry is internationally renowned for his kinetic theatrical design and puppetry.</p><p>Ashley
      Roland (artistic director at Bodyvox, a local Portland dance company) saw Diavolo
      on the ninth and called it a "very exciting spectacle."</p><p>Roland was impressed
      with the props and gymnastic ability in the performance. "The most striking
      part of the evening to me was in the second act and just the sheer bravery of
      those woman launching themselves 30 feet into the air," she said. However she
      found the lack of storyline to be disengaging. "I had hoped they could make
      more of a theatrical arc out of the piece. But they didn't and I felt it was
      a little empty," she said after seeing both acts of the performance.</p><p>Despite
      its lack of plot, Diavolo left audience members on the edges of their seats
      with its daring stunts, fluid movement, and overall aesthetic appeal.</p>

    - 'Comcast and TWC Merger: A Bad Idea for Americans'
    - The two largest cable companies in America want to become one.
    - |-
      <p>Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable companies operating in the United States, want to merge, and that's a big problem.</p><p>On February 13, 2014, Comcast revealed its plans to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) in a deal worth about $45 billion. The deal would see the two companies combine, furthering the gap between Comcast and America's third largest cable company, Charter Communications.</p><p>Using statistics from Google Analytics, the WebpageFX blog was able to construct a map of all 50 states showing the top internet service provider (ISP) in each state. The map showed that Comcast led the market in 18 states, including Texas and California, while TWC led in eight. If the merger clears regulatory review from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Comcast would be the leading ISP in 26 states, more than half of America.</p><p>According to data released by Leichtman Research Group, a company specializing in “research and analysis on broadband, media and entertainment industries," Comcast and TWC accounted for over 65 percent of all cable customers at the end of 2013, and over 38 percent of the entire broadband market in the United States. That's nearly twice as much as the third biggest American telecoms company, AT&amp;T. Comcast is so large that, in an effort to please regulators, they created a spin-off cable company, GreatLand Connections, and transferred 2.5 million of their customers over. Immediately, it became America's fifth largest ISP.</p><p>A Comcast and TWC merger would create an internet and cable television monopoly here in America, more so than Comcast's already large grasp on the broadband market. A monopoly in this space is the last thing American consumers need. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler revealed last month that about 80 percent of all Americans could only buy 25Mbps or better internet from a single provider. As the speed doubles to 50Mbps, the choice and availability is even more limited. Comcast holds partial blame for this severe lack of competition in most areas. In order to roll out its network to all customers in a city or region, local governments sign franchise agreements with Comcast that restrict the ability of other ISPs to come in and build infrastructure. Thus, it's difficult, especially for small start-ups, to innovate and create choice.</p><p>“At 25Mbps, there is simply no competitive choice for most Americans," Wheeler said in a speech at 1776. “Stop and let that sink in... three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice for the essential infrastructure for 21st century economics and democracy."</p><p>Not only do Americans have little choice in the broadband market, the speeds available to them are also subpar. According to the latest Broadband Progress Report released by the FCC, about 19 million, or over 16 percent of the American population, live in areas without any access to internet. Giant corporations such as Comcast make billions every year, yet they refuse to build infrastructure in rural and other areas without broadband service. Comcast buying out the competition would lessen their incentives to continue rollout in new areas.</p><p>While living in Baltimore, Rob Jamieson, a computer coding teacher at Franklin, felt the effects of severely limited options in broadband when Verizon FiOS was not available to him due to wiring issues.</p><p><blockquote class='article_inline_quote left'>

It was the only option."</p><p>The 2014 American Customer Service Index places both Comcast and TWC below all other telecoms companies. Stories of disgruntled Comcast customers are available all across the internet and just this summer, TWC had a nationwide service outage, leaving millions of their customers without internet access for hours.

    - Civil Rights Investigation in Ferguson Continues
    - ''
    - <p>On September 4 in Ferguson Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder announced
      that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would be launching a civil rights investigation
      into the Ferguson police department following the shooting of 18 year-old resident
      Michael Brown.</p><p>Ferguson activists, community leaders, as well as the police
      department of St. Louis County are welcoming a civil rights investigation to
      see if there was any racial profiling that led Officer Darren Wilson to shoot
      Michael Brown, which caused the Ferguson protests. Federal officials also said
      that they would be looking into police departments like other than Ferguson's,
      such as the St. Louis police department. The investigation is very important
      as it could lead to a federal takeover of the police. Michael Brown's shooting
      also sparked anger among African-American citizens, as dozens were arrested
      for looting. Tense interaction between protesters and law enforcement is still
      continuing, according to law enforcement of Ferguson and local media.</p><p>Officer
      Trevor Tyler from the Portland Police Bureau was informative about how officers
      train for crowd control in protests and other policing events. Tyler said, "When
      we train, we train to use the amount of force that is required to meet a situation."</p><p>Others
      also had a lot to say about Ferguson. Officer Schellman Brian, of the St. Louis
      police department, said new practices were being implemented into his police
      department. "Our chiefs of police, John Belmar, reached out to the Department
      of Justice to conduct for better practices." John Belmar is currently taking
      action to form new and improved practices.</p><p>The leader of the FHS Black
      Student Union, Ahmed Gedi, 12, gave his perspective on how he felt about the
      shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. "Really it's a common case
      of police brutality in the United States. I don't think we should be looking
      for reasons to try to incite more police violence where as we can quell it somehow…"</p><p>After
      one month of investigating, there are still no charges or Police Department
      conduct violations reported yet. However, Gedi still has hopes for justice in
      Ferguson. "My hopes in Ferguson is that it draws attention nationally to the
      whole greater issue in the United States, how your race effects how you're treated

    - God is Disappointed in You
    - Book Review
    - <p>God is Disappointed in You is a contemporary comedic summary of the Bible
      written by Mark Russell with cartoons by Shannon Wheeler. The book was published
      by Top Shelf Productions in August 2013, and quickly reached the top 25 and
      received positive reviews. Russell described the book as "a modern retelling
      of the bible, I like to explain it as the bible explained to somebody at a bar."</p><p>Russell
      decided on the subject because he grew up with the Bible and it's a "very important
      part of American cultural literacy; a lot of political decisions are made based
      on the Bible, people live their lives according to the Bible (or so they think)
      and yet nobody really seems to know anything about it. So it has this unique
      place in the zeitgeist of America that no other book does."</p><p>Russell was
      raised as a Born Again Christian "I was taught the belief that it was prophetic
      to things that were happening in these times and that our job on this planet
      is to fulfil the mission set forth by the Book of Revelations. Which is absolutely
      the most dangerous thing that a Christian or religious person can believe by
      the way." Russell said, "People were not living their lives to God's word as
      they understood it, they were creating God's word around their lives and giving
      it this underpinning of divinity it really didn't want." He believes there are
      a lot of misinterpretations about the Bible and one of the goals of his book
      is to clear up these misinterpretations.</p><p>On the process of making a book,
      Russell said "It all started with research." He studied the passages of The
      Bible over three years while also working a 9 to 5 job. Then he used his notes
      to write the "meat of the book" before adding humor and dialogue. Once written,
      Mark handed the book off to Wheeler to do the cartoons. With a book like this,
      one runs the risk of offending people. Nuns and pastors have bought the book
      and used it in sermons, whereas an atheist got offended at Russell for "drawing
      attention to The Bible". Russell said " Reverence is kind of the enemy of truth,
      and the more you're like 'oh I don't want to say this' you stop telling the
      truth at that point. You stop taking the book on its own merit and you're just
      trying to tiptoe around what you think people want to hear."</p>

    - White House Fence Jumper
    - What you should know
    - '<p>On Friday, September 19, a man named Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, was stopped by
      the Secret Service after jumping the White House fence. President Barack Obama
      had already left the House to Camp David to spend the weekend with his family.</p><p>After
      leaping over the fence, Gonzalez was detained for trespassing and ignoring orders
      to stop progressing into the White House. Gonzalez is a U.S army veteran who
      suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A federal charge would put Gonzalez
      in prison for 10 years. Gonzalez was also arrested back in July in rural Virginia,
      armed with an illegal firearm and carrying a map of Washington D.C, but he was
      released from jail on a $5,000 bond.</p><p>Two Franklin campus security personnel
      had thoughts to offer regarding this event, one giving his perspective on white
      house security. Domingo Urrutia said that white house security was lacking and
      it is a political issue now in the United States. Adam Shaw a member of FHS
      campus security, discussed on what he is instructed to do on a school campus
      to keep everyone safe.</p><p>"Basically we help the student movement to make
      sure people are where they''re supposed to be when they''re supposed to be there,"
      Shaw said. Shaw also explained details of a lockdown situation. "That can be
      a number of things, we could receive a call from someone in the neighborhood
      that there''s something strange going on outside. There are different types
      of lockdowns; there''s a lockdown when we shutdown the entire school and no
      one moves and we also have a lockdown called a team response when we have a
      student acting out in the classroom, so we''ll lock the school down."</p><p>After
      Gonzalez invaded the White House, the secret service''s director, Julia Pierson,
      stepped down over the scandal, in which she allowed President Barack Obama to
      be in an elevator with an armed man. This will possibly bring in a change of
      leadership, just as Urrutia wants: "They need a change of leadership within
      the Secret Service." Gonzalez is still in custody as of today. A federal judge

    - '<p>On Friday, September 19, a man named Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, was stopped by
      the Secret Service after jumping the White House fence. President Barack Obama
      had already left the House to Camp David to spend the weekend with his family.</p><p>After
      leaping over the fence, Gonzalez was detained for trespassing and ignoring orders
      to stop progressing into the White House. Gonzalez is a U.S army veteran who
      suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A federal charge would put Gonzalez
      in prison for 10 years. Gonzalez was also arrested back in July in rural Virginia,
      armed with an illegal firearm and carrying a map of Washington D.C, but he was
      released from jail on a $5,000 bond.</p><p>Two Franklin campus security personnel
      had thoughts to offer regarding this event, one giving his perspective on white
      house security. Domingo Urrutia said that white house security was lacking and
      it is a political issue now in the United States. Adam Shaw a member of FHS
      campus security, discussed on what he is instructed to do on a school campus
      to keep everyone safe.</p><p>"Basically we help the student movement to make
      sure people are where they''re supposed to be when they''re supposed to be there,"
      Shaw said. Shaw also explained details of a lockdown situation. "That can be
      a number of things, we could receive a call from someone in the neighborhood
      that there''s something strange going on outside. There are different types
      of lockdowns; there''s a lockdown when we shutdown the entire school and no
      one moves and we also have a lockdown called a team response when we have a
      student acting out in the classroom, so we''ll lock the school down."</p><p>After
      Gonzalez invaded the White House, the secret service''s director, Julia Pierson,
      stepped down over the scandal, in which she allowed President Barack Obama to
      be in an elevator with an armed man. This will possibly bring in a change of
      leadership, just as Urrutia wants: "They need a change of leadership within

      Childs was one of two coordinators of the Freshman First iPadProgram last year,

      $255,815 community grantfrom the Mount Hood Cable Regulatory Commission (MHCRC)
      was used to purchaseiPads which were then checked out to Franklin freshmen.

      asurvey done by kids – everybody reported everybody else was using them just

      to most students, but thesewouldn''t arrive any earlier than second semester.

      the Chromebooks won''t coverall kids, but they are working in partnership with
      GEAR UP to provideadditional devices."</p><p>        PPS teachers and administrators

      and turned away, leaning against the fence.</p><p>"Why did I remove their eyes?
      Your Honor, it was to show their blindness to the world around them. I also
      stripped them naked to show their vulnerability and shame…"</p><p>The pigs were

      thick coat of a grey wolf. He had lived out most of his days in the woods, and
      he smelled something nasty, a musty, pungent scent that clung to his fur like
      the water droplets that fell from the dense canopy above.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAster
      had busied herself with digging now, breaking through the top, rocky layer of
      soil using a shovel before abandoning the tool for the use of her hands. Soon,
      she was so heavily coated in mud and leaves that she resembled the very earth
      she was crouched upon, and it became impossible to tell girl from forest. She
      didn't mind it. After some time, Aster pulled from the earth a cluster of mud-encrusted
      mushrooms, of the highest quality. A wide smile spread across her dirt-spattered
      and densely freckled face. She sniffed. She sneezed, and let out a soft sigh.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a
      name=\"h.enu5qe42eivx\"></a>\"Making baaaank!\" Laughing, Aster gingerly placed
      the truffles into her knapsack, whistled for Benjamin, and, leaping over stumps

      and cedar branches gently brushed her face and moss clung to her shoes and soiled
      leggings. The only sounds were the soft squishing of her hiking boots on the
      overgrown path and Benjamin's heavy panting, with the occasional trilling of
      a distant bird. Aster breathed in deeply and inhaled the scent of the forest.
      So sharp, so heavy, so familiar. Rain began to fall, bringing with it another
      set of smells; decaying plant matter, waterlogged, ground-growing flowers, squirrels
      and mice shaking from the damp, well-worn wool socks gathering moisture. Aster
      much preferred the smells of the woods to the harsh chemicals of the city. Even
      as far from civilization as she was, her highly-developed sniffer could pick
      up the asphalt fumes from the nearest highway and she gagged, catching a whiff
      of cars and garbage on the breeze.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.ax2kzcf7r18j\"></a>Aster
      reached the edge of the woods and reluctantly pushed through the blackberry
      bushes that grew on the side of the road. She sniffed in disgust and pulled
      her scarf up to cover her nose and mouth. Moving swiftly, the small girl pulled
      her bicycle from beneath its hiding place, a large, drooping gooseberry bush.
      Benjamin bounded to her side and took his place in the large cart that she had
      fashioned to the back of the rusted vehicle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"h.gjdgxs\"></a>\"Time
      to go sell these things,\" she said, strapping on her helmet and oversized goggles.
      Maybe she would try the old hairy woman's farm today, it had been a long time
      since she'd tried peddling there. The ancient hag wasn't of the best temperament,
      but her eyes were poor and she would pay a good price for even the cruddiest
      of mushrooms. One kick and Aster was off, zipping down the water-slicked road.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a

      into the soft soil. The buttery, <strongr></strongr>earthy scent filled her
      nostrils, overwhelmingly sweet and mouthwatering. Hearing her cry, Benjamin
      <strongr></strongr>trotted to her side, his ears swiveling and tongue flapping.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strongr></strongr>\"Now
      smell this, and tell me I'm right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBenjamin dropped his massive

    - The Future of FHS Announcements
    - ''
    - "<p>\n\tFor the remainder of the school year at Franklin High School, students
      and staff will no longer hear daily announcements over the intercom. Instead,
      teachers will read announcements aloud to students.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnnouncements
      at Franklin High School have traditionally been an everyday occurrence. From
      now on, students will be reading the announcements by their teachers during
      second period on A-days, and sixth period on B-days.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis decision
      was made by FHS staff members, Jill Register, Vice Principal's Secretary and
      Dennis Joule, Vice Principal. The change was made because announcements over
      the intercom often took 10 minutes. According to Joule, that would be too much
      wasted instruction time. Some teachers don't remember to read the announcements,
      but Joule hopes that they will read them. Joule also thinks the intercom only
      needs to be used for important announcements.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We need to use
      that voice phone system for something that's important to our school,\" said
      Joule. A teacher at Franklin High School, Desi Zak, likes the new system for
      announcements. \"I think it's a good system as long as the teachers remember,
      myself included,\" said Zak. \"I often times forget unless someone reminds me.\"
      Zak has mixed feelings about the announcements over the intercom. She does appreciate
      when announcements come on because she doesn't have to think about it, but sometimes
      they run long and have errors. She likes to read them herself, but the problem
      is remembering to read them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJoule has hopes for this new system.
      \"In a perfect world, every teacher would have this beautiful bulletin board
      to put up long standing announcements.\" Joule also has ideas for a more technical
      conclusion. \"We would also like to eventually move to a monitor system where
      we have screens in the building that display information,\" he said.\n</p>"

    - "<p>\n        \tRecent events in both the World Cup and and in professional
      American football have led to the questioning of current concussion protocols.
      Players have been knocked out and sent stumbling to the ground, yet they've
      been allowed to continue playing through the rest of the game.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tThis past summer, more than 4,000 former professional
      football players in the NFL have sued over the past few years because of brain
      damage. They're suffering from early onset dementia and Alzheimer's, which have
      a direct correlation to concussion related brain injuries. The price these players
      have to pay is small, considering they could have died from second impact syndrome.
      This is caused by two blows to the head in close succession. As more information
      comes in, doctors, players, and fans have been questioning whether the current
      protocols are enough.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tI believe there
      need to be more strict regulations on head injuries. Second impact syndrome
      is a constant threat, and previous NFL players are showing increased signs of
      early onset dementia, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is potentially one of the most dangerous risks of
      playing football. In 2013, about 4500 former NFL players sued the NFL for concussion-related
      injuries. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a
      study on 3,349 former NFL players, and found that the risk of neurodegenerative
      disease was three times higher than the average population. Additionally there
      has been an increased number of suicide and death rates in the NFL. Jovan Belcher,
      a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, fatally shot his girlfriend and then shot
      himself in the team parking lot in 2012. After doing a brain autopsy, they found
      evidence consistent with damage found in CTE sufferers. Other instances like
      this have surfaced as researchers are becoming more and more interested in their
      findings. No doctors have been able to confirm a direct cause, but additional
      evidence from autopsies and brain scans continues to suggest more detailed conclusions.\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tWhile watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup
      this summer, I saw Christoph Kramer get a serious blow to the head in the World
      Cup final. The doctors came running out and within about 40 seconds they deemed
      him able to play. Kramer fell down 15 minutes later and had to be helped off
      of the field. Reports from the referee surfaced after the game that Kramer asked
      him if he was really playing in the World Cup final. According to ww.nfl.com
      it takes between 8-12 minutes to examine a concussion. It also appears that
      Kramer made the decision on his own to keep playing. In a situation when the
      player is clearly dazed, the player shouldn't have a say in whether they get
      to come back on the field.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tTo see the
      lasting effect of one decision, look no further than Taylor Twellman, who played
      for the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer before suffering a career-ending
      concussion. Twellman suffered seven concussions between ages 10 and 28, and
      has started a charity called THINKTaylor to help raise awareness about concussions.
      Twellman's life was turned upside down after his last concussion, when he lost
      the ability to read a book or watch a whole movie. He didn't recover for years.
      \"You do not need a big impact to suffer a concussion, just like you don't have
      to be knocked out cold. And brave? My life has changed completely because 'I
      showed heart' and 'bravely' carried on playing,\" Twellman said in an article
      for the guardian.com.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOver this past summer,
      the English Premier League has instituted some changes to their concussion protocols.
      Now there must be a 'tunnel doctor' to assess the player's condition, and a
      new concussion recognition tool must be carried and used. Premier League Director
      of Football Mike Foster said to premierleague.com that, \"Premier League clubs
      have already addressed a number of recommendations by making changes to the
      Premier League Rule Book and we recognise that, with other stakeholders, we
      have a wider role to play in making all participants in the game aware of the
      signs of concussion and the importance of following the return to play guidelines.\"\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tDespite these new achievements, these are
      still very flawed rules. Who determines whether the doctors followed the concussion
      recognition tool provided? In addition, the 'tunnel doctors' are paid for by
      the team and not the league. Each team wants to make money and there is a chance
      that the doctors won't pull the best player from a match. The new protocol was
      tested on October 6, 2014 when Thibaut Courtois suffered a blow to the head
      and lost consciousness. The doctors assessed him for about a minute and then
      deemed him able to play. 15 minutes later, he sat down by the goal and could
      not continue. In this case, the new rules didn't actually change anything and
      were more just a way of pleasing concerned viewers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThe mere fact that the issues around concussions are now common knowledge
      is a great achievement, but recent incidents have proven that they still aren't
      enough. The world of professional sports needs to get their act together before
      anything gets worse.\n        </p>"
    - "<p>\n        \tRecent events in both the World Cup and and in professional
      American football have led to the questioning of current concussion protocols.
      Players have been knocked out and sent stumbling to the ground, yet they've
      been allowed to continue playing through the rest of the game.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tThis past summer, more than 4,000 former professional
      football players in the NFL have sued over the past few years because of brain
      damage. They're suffering from early onset dementia and Alzheimer's, which have
      a direct correlation to concussion related brain injuries. The price these players
      have to pay is small, considering they could have died from second impact syndrome.
      This is caused by two blows to the head in close succession. As more information
      comes in, doctors, players, and fans have been questioning whether the current
      protocols are enough.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tI believe there
      need to be more strict regulations on head injuries. Second impact syndrome
      is a constant threat, and previous NFL players are showing increased signs of
      early onset dementia, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is potentially one of the most dangerous risks of
      playing football. In 2013, about 4500 former NFL players sued the NFL for concussion-related
      injuries. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued a
      study on 3,349 former NFL players, and found that the risk of neurodegenerative
      disease was three times higher than the average population. Additionally there
      has been an increased number of suicide and death rates in the NFL. Jovan Belcher,
      a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, fatally shot his girlfriend and then shot
      himself in the team parking lot in 2012. After doing a brain autopsy, they found
      evidence consistent with damage found in CTE sufferers. Other instances like
      this have surfaced as researchers are becoming more and more interested in their

    - "<p>\n\tOn October 24, many students in a high school in Marysville, Washington,
      were in the cafeteria having lunch. Suddenly, across the cafeteria, a gunshot
      rang out. Then several more. Students panicked and fled. Those still in class
      huddled under desks and locked the doors, waiting for the police to arrive.
      Students, teachers, and civilians alike were shocked to discover the identity
      of the shooter: Jaylen Fryburg, a popular and successful member of the local
      community. Also shocking is the identity of his five victims: three close friends
      and two cousins. He cared about all of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJaylen Fryburg (9)
      lured the victims to the school cafeteria by text message that day before open
      firing on them with a .40-caliber handgun. He then shot himself and inflicted
      a fatal wound, dying at the scene. The gun belonged to the family, but it is
      unknown how he managed to obtain it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOut of the six victims, only
      one is confirmed as alive. Zoe Galasso died on the scene of the shooting due
      to a bullet in the head. The three other deaths, Gia Soriano, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit,
      and Andrew Fryburg, occurred in the hospital. Nate Hatch, the shooter's cousin,
      was in intensive care but showed significant improvement and was released on

      said. \"It takes someone truly twisted to do something like that.\" A growing
      concern surrounding school shootings is the \"will it happen to us?\" mindset.
      When asked if she felt safe at Franklin, Sveen said, \"I think a school shooting
      is possible. There are crazy people everywhere.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDomingo Urrutia,

      when you've died at the ripe age of 18. Damn, I was just starting college with
      my boyfriend too, was planning on moving into the dorms with him and majoring
      in pre-med, a bit ironic don't you think so? A kid wanting to become a doctor
      ended up dying before he could even save others. It's not like I'm bitter about
      my death. It's been too long and the indignation has sort of faded away. But
      now, I'm simply a ghost, wandering around my old life and sometimes wishing
      I was alive again. In this moment though, I most definitely wish I was alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe
      were both drunk, dumb ready-to-be college students partying in his dilapidated
      car. He was going too fast, I was drunkenly singing and before we both knew
      it he'd crash the car into a tree. I died and he survived. Now, he's a successful
      business man, age 32, rich to the core, but he says that there's something that
      money can never fill and it was the hole in his heart. The hole that was I once
      settled in.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, I'm floating, my body transparent and vaporous,
      and I'm still wearing the jacket he gave me before that car accident. I'm hovering
      over his bed, smoothing my hand across the duvet. He walks into the bedroom,
      dressed up in all black, his hair smooth and combed to the right. The only color
      on him is a bouquet of white and red chrysanthemums. His eyes are bloodshot;
      he's been crying. I'm hit with the realization that today is my death anniversary.
      He's been coming to my grave every year each time asking for my forgiveness
      and all I can do is trail after him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere's a swirling smoke
      of grief inside the car. It's suffocating me, yet there's a mixture of familiarity
      and tranquility. I don't know why. He stops the car and gets ready. I can feel
      his heart slowly tearing and I want to hold him, but I can't. He's already walking
      towards my grave when I come back to the moment. I step through the car, my
      legs passing through the door and slightly hover over the worn out dirt. By
      the time I float towards him, he's softly murmuring. I can hear his words spilling
      out of his mouth. He keeps apologizing, saying how the accident was his fault,
      telling me that he wish he could be dead, how much I deserve life more than
      him. His voice is like falling glass, fragile and shattering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      want to scream at him and tell him how wrong he is; I want to caress him and
      tell him that no matter what I still love him. My fingers slip pass him like
      mist he shivers and looks behind himself. He can't see me, he can't anymore.
      There's a desolate feeling inside my chest. Stray tears fall from his icy eyes.
      He brings up his fingers to smooth over the name on my grave. My eyes shift
      up and I read what's on it: In Loving Memory of Ezer Morte, 1982-2000.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      wish I were alive again.\n</p>"

      I was alive again. In this moment though, I most definitely wish I was alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe
      were both drunk, dumb ready-to-be college students partying in his dilapidated
      car. He was going too fast, I was drunkenly singing and before we both knew
      it he'd crash the car into a tree. I died and he survived. Now, he's a successful
      business man, age 32, rich to the core, but he says that there's something that
      money can never fill and it was the hole in his heart. The hole that was I once
      settled in.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, I'm floating, my body transparent and vaporous,
      and I'm still wearing the jacket he gave me before that car accident. I'm hovering
      over his bed, smoothing my hand across the duvet. He walks into the bedroom,
      dressed up in all black, his hair smooth and combed to the right. The only color
      on him is a bouquet of white and red chrysanthemums. His eyes are bloodshot;
      he's been crying. I'm hit with the realization that today is my death anniversary.
      He's been coming to my grave every year each time asking for my forgiveness
      and all I can do is trail after him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere's a swirling smoke
      of grief inside the car. It's suffocating me, yet there's a mixture of familiarity
      and tranquility. I don't know why. He stops the car and gets ready. I can feel
      his heart slowly tearing and I want to hold him, but I can't. He's already walking
      towards my grave when I come back to the moment. I step through the car, my
      legs passing through the door and slightly hover over the worn out dirt. By
      the time I float towards him, he's softly murmuring. I can hear his words spilling
      out of his mouth. He keeps apologizing, saying how the accident was his fault,
      telling me that he wish he could be dead, how much I deserve life more than
      him. His voice is like falling glass, fragile and shattering.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      want to scream at him and tell him how wrong he is; I want to caress him and
      tell him that no matter what I still love him. My fingers slip pass him like
      mist he shivers and looks behind himself. He can't see me, he can't anymore.
      There's a desolate feeling inside my chest. Stray tears fall from his icy eyes.
      He brings up his fingers to smooth over the name on my grave. My eyes shift
      up and I read what's on it: In Loving Memory of Ezer Morte, 1982-2000.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      wish I were alive again.\n</p>"

      The emotions pouring from these words will make readers connect to the story like no other before. Being dead really sucks, but what sucks more is watching the ones you love right suffer in front of you.

    - ''
    - "<p>\n\tThe Yemeni capital, Sanaa, was overthrown by the Houthis, a group belonging
      to the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam, on September 21, 2014. To show their authority,
      the Houthis took over the TV stations a couple days prior to overthrowing the
      capital. Mohammed Basindawa, the prime minister, was overthrown, and thousands
      have evacuated the nation due to civil unrest and potentially dangerous situations.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The
      situation escalated very slowly,\" said Max Horten, a student in Yemen during
      this time and a Cleveland alumnus. \"The government and the Houthis were negotiating
      throughout the time they were encircling the city, and there were some days
      when it looked like the talks could go somewhere, and other times when more
      serious fighting looked likely.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMax evacuated on the morning
      of September 21, and even though he was never in a dangerous situation, he felt
      \"it wasn't worth being in that environment anymore.\" In the last few days
      he was in Yemen, he could hear gunshots and explosions coming from only a few
      kilometers away.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHorten's mother, Anette Horten, said, \"We were
      very anxious for Max's safety. He was in our minds constantly, and we sought
      out as much information as we could.\" She mentioned that it was hard trying
      to find a reliable source for information because the situation changed on a
      day-to-day basis. However, the connections Max built with people in Yemen were
      the reason it was so hard for him to leave.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMax said, \"Yemen
      is full of some very generous, kind, curious people.\" Some are in support of
      the Houthis control, while others are just frustrated with the political system
      in Yemen. \"My own view is that Yemen could still come out for the better from
      all of this, especially if the Houthis are sincere about their wish to institute
      a technocratic government and no more. But if it is all just a facade for another
      power grab by a different group, Yemeni cynicism about politics will harden
      and anything resembling democracy in Yemen will suffer a huge setback.\" In
      more simple words, Max\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, the Houthis still aren't backing
      down and no single political figure has taken charge. The constant bombings
      and shootings serve as evidence that no compromise has been reached.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"No
      one, not even the powerful groups in Yemen, knows how things will turn out in
      the coming months,\"said Anette Horten. She, and many others, hope that Yemen
      can find a way to avoid a civil war that would create a more impoverished society
      and that the different groups will be able to share control over the national
      government.\n</p>"

    - Gamergate
    - ''
    - "<p>\n        \tGamergate is a social media movement that has become a conflict
      between feminists and people calling for journalistic ethics in the gaming industry
      that has erupted across the internet, especially on 4chan, Reddit, 8chan, and
      Twitter, using the hashtag #Gamergate. Many people who use the Gamergate hashtag
      say that the movement is addressing corrupt journalism, but the mainstream media
      coverage has generally framed 'Gamergaters' as misogynists who think they own
      the video game industry.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe controversy
      began in August when game developer Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend posted extensive
      blog posts alleging that she had slept with Nathan Grayson, a writer for video
      game blog Kotaku. The implication was that she had slept with Grayson and others
      during their relationship in order to receive better coverage of her game <em>Depression
      Quest</em>. Though Quinn and Grayson both denied having traded sex for game
      coverage, incensed gamers had already taken to social networks, protesting the
      apparent ethics breach, and setting the Gamergate movement in motion.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tQuinn and other women in the gaming industry began receiving
      threats from people associating themselves with Gamergate. Included in those
      attacked was Anita Sarkeesian of <em>Feminist Frequency</em>, a video webseries
      \"exploring the representations of women in pop culture narratives.\" Sarkeesian
      eventually became a prominent figure in opposition to Gamergate. She was invited
      to speak at Utah State University in October about the portrayal of women in
      video games, but had to cancel her presentation when the university received
      threats of a school shooting if she were allowed to speak. Utah state law prohibits
      colleges from restricting gun carriers with a concealed weapons permit, so her
      proposition to continue the lecture with tightened security was ruled out.\n
      \       </p>\n        <p>\n        \tKieran Andrews (10), a self-described gamer,
      sees Gamergate as \"a loud minority of people in the gaming society that are
      afraid of change,\" and believes that as video games become popular among people
      of all races, ages, and genders, some men are afraid of the increasing involvement
      of women in video game culture.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tLeader
      of Franklin's League of Legends Club, Matthew Fairman (11), on the other hand,
      approved of Gamergate's original call for journalistic ethics.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t\"I feel that originally it wasn't about feminism, but
      now Anita Sarkeesian is using that as a shield to gather supporters behind her,\"
      Fairman said. \"It started as something [real], it blew up, and now it is just
      a mainstream headline: <em>male masses target poor females, feminist leader</em>.\"
      He thinks the media coverage of Gamergate does not show the whole picture, but
      rather that \"all the world is hearing about, all the mainstream media is hearing
      about, is the threats. They're not hearing about any of the arguments.\"\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tAt this point Fairman thinks Gamergate is simply giving
      gamers a bad name, and that they should back off from the movement. Andrews
      agrees, \"The word Gamergate is now tainted. You could write an entire speech
      about ethics in gaming journalism, and if you use the word Gamergate once, your
      entire speech gets thrown out the window. \"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tFor
      the most part, the Gamergate movement has lost its momentum. Statistics from
      Google show that web traffic related to Gamergate has died down considerably
      since it peaked in late October. The issue of misogyny in previously male-dominated
      industries, however, will surely continue to incite debate in the future.\n

    - Australia May Silence More Than Just Whistleblowers With New Legislation
    - ''
    - "<p>\n\tIn an age where a new whistleblower seems to come to the attention of
      the media daily, we are in danger of becoming desensitized to the stories that
      these people convey, and instead treat them as just another tattle tale. The
      question stops becoming what the whistleblowers are reporting, and instead becomes
      what happens to them afterwards in the eyes of their government.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis
      is exactly what Australia is attempting to focus on after new legislation was
      passed by the Australian Senate on September 25. These laws emphasize exactly
      what is supposed to happen to anyone who points a criticizing finger at the
      government. This umbrella usage of \"whistleblower\" includes everyone from
      those within the government who divulge secrets, to even well-meaning journalists.
      If something seems off with this, then you're heading in the right direction.
      This piece of legislature is written in such a way that any benefit these leaks
      may provide to the public becomes irrelevant. Individuals who release any government
      information, no matter the importance, will face prison sentences of at least
      five years.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis sentence is absolutely outrageous, considering
      that most of these people are simply attempting to do their jobs and make their
      country's government a more open process. This bill is just another in a long
      line of reactions by governments across the world aiming to protect themselves
      from the likes of Edward Snowden. It is remarkable that one man's actions have
      caused governments around the world to change how they deal with whistleblowers
      and minimize their effect. Australia is simply the most recent; the passage
      of this legislature came just days a few days after Freya Newman, a 21-year-old
      whistleblower, pleaded guilty to accessing private records at the Whitehouse
      School of Design in Sydney. Newman's suspicions of a scholarship being wrongly
      given to the Australian Prime Minister's daughter provoked her to illegally
      access private records. Her findings supported her but the public had little
      response, excluding the prosecution of Freya herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy allowing
      yet another government to go ahead with this campaign against whistleblowers
      we also encourage the silencing of possible informants. If fewer people are
      willing to speak up about their government, then there is a high possibility
      that the public will become dangerously uninformed. Countries have time and
      time again used brute force as an approach when it comes to dealing with whistleblowers,
      instead of the delicate touch that is necessary. Take Snowden for example: he
      immediately left the country and hopped from nation to nation, constantly staying
      away from America's reach until he settled in Russia, where he has lived for
      over 15 months. All the while he was not only accused of numerous crimes, which
      were not unfounded, but also was called things such as \"traitor\" and \"coward\"
      by everyone from Government officials to the media. If governments around the
      world wish to maintain any kind of charade of translucence through the government
      process, then it would behoove them to not seem so nasty when it comes to dealing
      with their accusers.\n</p>"

    - The Delish Thai Dish
    - A mouthwatering review
    - "<p>\n\tAn authentic and delicious destination by the name of Thai Dish is located
      in the upper Hawthorne area on 46th avenue. It is worth walking a few extra
      blocks from the trendy main shopping area to get a taste of Thai Dish's cuisine.
      They serve a variety of Thai food, as evident in the name, from soups to desserts.
      The inside of this destination is noticeably clean with soft pop music playing
      in the background. Christmas lights and personal photos adorn the walls.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor
      my main dish, I ordered Pad Kee Mao with pork, also known as Spicy Basil Noodles
      or Drunken Noodles. It was served in a large portion with a twisted orange for
      garnish, which was a special touch. The noodles were thick and thankfully did
      not clump together like I have seen at other Thai restaurants. The flavor was
      a medley of soy sauce, sweet basil and subtle spiciness, with the small pieces
      of pork tasty and well cooked. Thai Dish is more than happy to adjust the spice
      level of certain entrees. Bean sprouts and broccoli added a crisp bite to contrast
      to the chewy noodles. The bell pepper was an interesting addition that added
      something unique to the flavor profile.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir Thai iced tea was
      traditionally refreshing; the sweet creaminess was balanced perfectly with the
      strong brewed tea. At Thai Dish I have also tried the yellow curry, Pad Thai,
      and Pad See Ew. The fried tofu is a great protein to choose for a dish; its
      soft texture soaks up flavors well and will be enjoyed by vegetarians and omnivores
      alike.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI always enjoy the consistency of the meals at Thai Dish
      and have yet to order something that was not made with care. It is a wonderful
      local business to support by stopping in for lunch, dinner or take out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\thttp://www.thaidishcuisine.com/\n</p>"

      scene here at Franklin, but the homogenized nature of our calculators imply
      something more sinister. If any other school supply was so standardized, students
      would be outraged. I personally know some students who would never be without
      their Dixon Ticonderogas, but some swear by a mechanical model. Why are calculators
      different?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tTexas
      Instruments hold an often unnoticed pseudo-monopoly over our calculators. The
      Dallas-based corporation got its start manufacturing microchips and conductors
      in the 1930s, and calculators became a subdivision. Their \"Educational Technology\"
      only makes up 4% of their inventory, but for the 2013 revenue report, TI calculators
      raked in a whopping 2.6 billion dollars.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEven with the booming semiconductor business supporting this
      endeavor, calculators aren't cheap. A basic TI-83 costs around $120, and advanced
      models can reach up to almost $200. That's a huge cost barrier for something
      considered necessary for over half the math classes offered at Franklin High
      School.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tThe thing
      is, TI isn't a monopoly -- not even close. There are twice as many approved
      calculators for non-TI brands on the AP list, and many of these Casio and HP
      brands often cost a fraction of the price. The fact that these can offer the
      same functions for less is a serious cause for suspicion.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tWe've been fed the TI agenda through
      sheer familiarity. It's no fault of any administration; it's simply the culture
      that's arisen. Some math textbooks contain sections specifically devoted to
      using a TI calculator. Nearly every math class is stocked with 30 TI's, and
      the Franklin library lends over 250 calculators to students. These calculators
      were purchased in years previous with PTA grants, and their homogeneity is maintained.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \t\"If a student
      loses a calculator, I have them buy a new one,\" said Marjie Chambers, Bookroom
      Clerk of the Franklin Library and manager of their calculator supply. \"If a
      student loses a TI-model calculator, they usually replace it with a TI-model.\"
      The overwhelming conformity of current calculator brands keeps the supply firmly
      in the grip of Texas Instruments.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tSo why does it matter? Texas Instruments produces a fine calculator.
      I've got a lovely little TI-83 I picked up about two years ago. The problem
      is that TI, with their cultural advantage, may change calculator costs on arbitrary
      whims.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tStandardized
      tests like the ACT and the SAT claim to need no calculator, but the student
      with one saves time on basic computations, time that can lead to a better score.
      In the context of AP testing, some calculators, like the TI-89, can solve indefinite
      integrals and derivatives, automating a crucial step in calculus. Having a high-functioning
      calculator is a distinct advantage, but the high prices of TI models and their
      limited supply in schools serve as an economic barrier.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tIf you're low on funds, don't be afraid
      to try something outside the TI box (after a little research on your specific
      model, mind you). Encouraging diversity in calculators could create the competition
      necessary to shake TI off its throne, lowering their prices, and possibly encouraging
      innovation. Without the default cultural advantage, TI might need to find a
      way to improve their \"classic\" models with something more substantial than
      a change of color schematics.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tSo
      go ahead, try the other brands; the first thing you can calculate is the difference
      you'll make.\n                </p>"

      in the grip of Texas Instruments.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tSo why does it matter? Texas Instruments produces a fine calculator.
      I've got a lovely little TI-83 I picked up about two years ago. The problem
      is that TI, with their cultural advantage, may change calculator costs on arbitrary
      whims.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tStandardized
      tests like the ACT and the SAT claim to need no calculator, but the student
      with one saves time on basic computations, time that can lead to a better score.
      In the context of AP testing, some calculators, like the TI-89, can solve indefinite
      integrals and derivatives, automating a crucial step in calculus. Having a high-functioning
      calculator is a distinct advantage, but the high prices of TI models and their
      limited supply in schools serve as an economic barrier.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tIf you're low on funds, don't be afraid
      to try something outside the TI box (after a little research on your specific
      model, mind you). Encouraging diversity in calculators could create the competition
      necessary to shake TI off its throne, lowering their prices, and possibly encouraging
      innovation. Without the default cultural advantage, TI might need to find a
      way to improve their \"classic\" models with something more substantial than
      a change of color schematics.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tSo
      go ahead, try the other brands; the first thing you can calculate is the difference
      you'll make.\n                </p>"

      by the Franklin High School Art 3-4 students. This fall, the Art 3-4 teachers,
      Ms. Berning and Mr. Perez, decided to have their students beautify the campus.

      street art assignment is used to teach the students that art has many purposes.
      \"Street art is more accessible to the general public who may be intimidated

      culpable homicide in the High Court of South Africa in Pretoria, South Africa.

      he mistook her for an intruder. Steenkamp was in the bathroom and Pistorius
      shot through the door and took her life. Judge Thokozile Masipa sentenced him

      He wears prosthetics on both of his legs that some have claimed give him an
      unfair advantage. However, after winning a legal dispute about his prosthetics,
      he was allowed to compete. He won gold in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in both

    - Gone Girl Movie Review
    - A thrilling suspense explained
    - "<p>\n        \t\"What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done
      to each other?\" Nick Dunne, the protagonist, says these are the primary questions
      of a \"good\" marriage in the movie <em>Gone Girl</em>, directed by David Fincher.
      Ben Affleck portrays Nick Dunne, a \"corn fed, salt of the earth Missouri boy\"
      who meets and eventually marries Amy Elliott, played by Rosamund Pike. Their
      marriage starts off perfectly, with both partners working as writers in New
      York City. Their relationship starts going downhill when both of them lose their
      jobs and have to move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri. One day, Nick comes
      home from his job at the local bar and finds Amy missing. The media spotlight
      immediately points to Nick as the suspect as more and more evidence against
      him piles up.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tBased off the novel by Gillian
      Flynn, <em>Gone Girl </em>came out in early October, and has already passed
      all of David Fincher's other work in the the North American box offices. It
      is predicted to hit $150 million in the U.S. alone.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tOne of the aspects of this movie that drew me in is the constant suspense.
      Right from the first line in the movie until the closing credits, I couldn't
      take my eyes off the screen. The score, composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus
      Ross, complimented each scene by reflecting the emotional tone and overall feeling
      of the scene.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tWhile <em>Gone Girl </em>was
      one of the most engaging movies I have ever seen, there was a distinct lack
      of character development. The character's personalities seemed to be engineered
      specifically to fit all the twists and turns of the plot. It took away from
      the movie and made it harder to empathize with any of the characters.\n        </p>\n

    - A New Era for Android
    - Bigger phones on the way
    - "<p>\n\tGoogle recently made one of the largest announcements of the year in
      their classic style. On October 15, there was no big convention, no large auditorium
      showcasing Google's achievements, not even an interview–simply a blog post.
      The post in question addressed Google's popular mobile operating system, Android,
      and what was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars
      of Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAndroid is so important that according to a report
      by comScore, an American company specializing in the collection of data, Android
      is used in over 50 percent of America's smartphones. When you look at the entire
      world, the numbers only become more staggering. A statement released by International
      Data Corporation says that 84.7 percent of the world's smartphones run Android,
      and the number continues to grow. Google plans to help this growth with a three-step
      process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Google is overhauling the look of Android by implementing
      a new visual language, which has been dubbed Material design. Material design
      has been an instant hit with many early adopters, and is a key aspect of the
      new iteration of Android, Android Lollipop. Another important part of Lollipop
      is simplicity, as Google's Vice President of Design Matias Duarte recently said
      in an interview with The Verge.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We want to find ways to do more,
      be smarter, but at the same time put less burden on the user.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond,
      Google is adding two new mobile devices that both run Lollipop, the Nexus 6
      and 9. These devices are manufactured by companies like Asus or Samsung, and
      then are sold by and serviced through Google. The Nexus 9, this year's tablet,
      features top of the line technical specs and stock Android. There are two big
      things that have pushed the Nexus 6, the new phone, into the news lately, one
      being the screen–which is a 5.96\" behemoth that many see as too big for their
      hands. The other is the price. The Nexus 6 starts at $650 unlocked (the same
      as the iPhone 6), a major change from the $350 precedent set by the Nexus 5,
      which was last year's model. Still, it is obvious why Google had to make the
      jump. When the Nexus 5 was released many had complaints. The battery wasn't
      strong enough, the camera wasn't good enough. Due to this Google set out to
      make an Android phone that had the best possible performance in every category,
      and the answer they came up with was the Nexus 6. Google executive Sandeep Waraich
      explained the price point in an interview with CNET. \"It was a deliberate decision
      to push the boundaries of technology. We first arrived at the solution, then
      the price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final stage of Google's plan that is the Android
      platform is the introduction of the Nexus Player, which integrates their TV-streaming
      service, Android TV. This is not Google's first attempt, the \"Chromecast\"
      is another device that streamed media from your Android device to your television.
      On the other hand, the Nexus Player uses a remote, while also allowing devices
      to connect to the Player. Another big difference between the two devices is
      the price. The Chromecast was touted as a cheap alternative when it was released
      in 2013 at $35, while the Nexus Player comes in at $100.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn October
      15, Google changed how their Android operating system will grow and operate
      for the next few years, and this affects much of today's technology-oriented
      society. The most important part of this is how much consumers are willing to
      pay, as many Nexus faithful have jumped off of the bandwagon in the past month.
      This last September marked the sixth birthday of Android, and in those six years
      Android has accomplished amazing feats, including the widespread adoption of
      Android devices across the planet. The only thing left to see is what Google
      will add next year to what can already be considered to be one of the major
      technological advancements of the 21st century so far.\n</p>"

      and what was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars
      of Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAndroid is so important that according to a report
      by comScore, an American company specializing in the collection of data, Android
      is used in over 50 percent of America's smartphones. When you look at the entire
      world, the numbers only become more staggering. A statement released by International
      Data Corporation says that 84.7 percent of the world's smartphones run Android,
      and the number continues to grow. Google plans to help this growth with a three-step
      process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Google is overhauling the look of Android by implementing
      a new visual language, which has been dubbed Material design. Material design
      has been an instant hit with many early adopters, and is a key aspect of the
      new iteration of Android, Android Lollipop. Another important part of Lollipop
      is simplicity, as Google's Vice President of Design Matias Duarte recently said
      in an interview with The Verge.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We want to find ways to do more,
      be smarter, but at the same time put less burden on the user.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond,
      Google is adding two new mobile devices that both run Lollipop, the Nexus 6
      and 9. These devices are manufactured by companies like Asus or Samsung, and
      then are sold by and serviced through Google. The Nexus 9, this year's tablet,
      features top of the line technical specs and stock Android. There are two big
      things that have pushed the Nexus 6, the new phone, into the news lately, one
      being the screen–which is a 5.96\" behemoth that many see as too big for their
      hands. The other is the price. The Nexus 6 starts at $650 unlocked (the same
      as the iPhone 6), a major change from the $350 precedent set by the Nexus 5,
      which was last year's model. Still, it is obvious why Google had to make the
      jump. When the Nexus 5 was released many had complaints. The battery wasn't
      strong enough, the camera wasn't good enough. Due to this Google set out to
      make an Android phone that had the best possible performance in every category,
      and the answer they came up with was the Nexus 6. Google executive Sandeep Waraich
      explained the price point in an interview with CNET. \"It was a deliberate decision
      to push the boundaries of technology. We first arrived at the solution, then
      the price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final stage of Google's plan that is the Android
      platform is the introduction of the Nexus Player, which integrates their TV-streaming
      service, Android TV. This is not Google's first attempt, the \"Chromecast\"
      is another device that streamed media from your Android device to your television.
      On the other hand, the Nexus Player uses a remote, while also allowing devices
      to connect to the Player. Another big difference between the two devices is
      the price. The Chromecast was touted as a cheap alternative when it was released
      in 2013 at $35, while the Nexus Player comes in at $100.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn October
      15, Google changed how their Android operating system will grow and operate
      for the next few years, and this affects much of today's technology-oriented
      society. The most important part of this is how much consumers are willing to
      pay, as many Nexus faithful have jumped off of the bandwagon in the past month.
      This last September marked the sixth birthday of Android, and in those six years
      Android has accomplished amazing feats, including the widespread adoption of
      Android devices across the planet. The only thing left to see is what Google
      will add next year to what can already be considered to be one of the major
      technological advancements of the 21st century so far.\n</p>"
    - "​Google recently made one of the largest announcements of the year in their
      classic style. On October 15, there was no big convention, no large auditorium
      showcasing Google's achievements, not even an interview–simply a blog post.
      The post in question addressed Google's popular mobile operating system, Android,
      and what was to come next for what has become one of the most important pillars
      of Google."

      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tPortland entered
      a new dimension of stage presence on November 17th when Flying Lotus and his
      team brought their Audio/Visual spectacle to the Roseland Theater. Steven Ellison,
      otherwise known as Flying Lotus, has been a rising star in his craft. His critically
      acclaimed, multi-genre music has made a substantial mark in the music-production
      world. His unique sound combines Jazz, Hip-Hop, and R&amp;B to create Trip-hop.
      His tour, which has covered most of North America, follows his recent album
      release \"You're Dead.\" The album features many big name artists such as MF
      Doom, Kendrick Lamar, and Snoop Dogg. It also features Ellison's good friend
      Thundercat, who is the opening act on the tour.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEllison, who is a big fan of visual arts, brought along multi-media
      artists Timeboy and Strangeloop to create what Ellison calls 'Layer 3.'\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t\"I always wanted to do something that
      felt really cinematic,\" said Ellison, on a cold walk through downtown Portland.
      \"I came up with the concept of Layer 3, and people told me that I couldn't
      do it, that it wasn't possible.\"\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tThe 3rd layer to Ellison's show is a special transparent screen
      that allows the two artists to project visuals both in front and behind Ellison,
      creating a 3D visual effect like no other. The artists created visuals to match
      Ellison's set, which gave the show a magical feeling.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tFlying Lotus's complex rhythms and blending
      of jazz and hip-hop textures make his sound one-of-a-kind. \"In the early days,
      I told myself one day I'll figure out how to blend the worlds together,\" said
      Ellison. \"One day I'll figure out how to make this Jazzy, Hip-hop thing.\"
      And that's exactly what he did.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tHis show was unreal, playing a straight 2-hour set of music.
      He played songs from most of his albums as well as the fan favorites, such as
      his song with Compton-based rapper Kendrick Lamar. His flawless set left the
      crowd in a long lasting chant for an encore. After the show the crowd outside
      was blown away. People were raving to each other about their favorite visuals
      and songs. The tour is set to play Seattle on the 18th, then move into Canada.
      I highly recommend listening to any one of his albums, which you can find online
      or purchase from iTunes.\n                </p>"

    - Former Franklin teacher celebrates 100th birthday
    - "<p>\n                \tThe house on the Willamette riverfront in which retired
      Franklin science teacher Dario Raschio was born has been demolished for years,
      but Saint Michael's Parish still stands just a quarter mile west, surrounded
      by the tall gray buildings that now make up downtown Portland. This is where
      Raschio was baptized, had his First Communion, and where his children and grandchildren
      have been baptized as well.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tRaschio
      celebrated his 100th birthday on November 10, his church outdating him by about
      20 years, having been founded in 1894 by Italian Catholic immigrants. Portland's
      'Little Italy' neighborhood, where Raschio grew up. has since been developed
      almost to the point of being unrecognizable, but Saint Michael the Archangel
      Catholic Parish serves as a reminder of the area's history.\n                </p>\n

      \               <p>\n                \tAfter attending grade school at St. Michael's,
      Raschio went to St. Stephen's High School in SE Portland, where he remembers
      playing baseball against Franklin. After high school, he enrolled in the pharmacy
      program at North Pacific College, but transferred to OSU a year later, switching
      into the PreMed program, and ultimately into teaching.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tIt was difficult to find work in the
      heart of the Great Depression, and Raschio applied for all kinds of jobs across
      the state before finally getting a letter granting him an interview for a teaching
      position in Gold Beach, OR. At the same time, he received a telegram offering
      him a job as a government clerk in Washington, D.C. The job in Gold Beach would
      have only paid $85 a month, while the job being handed to him in D.C. paid $100
      a month, so Raschio traveled across the country to the capital. Two years later,
      in September 1941, a gathering was held in D.C. where the names of ten men were
      drawn for the ceremonial part of the army draft.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \t\"Guess who was one of the ten? Lucky me,\" Raschio jokes.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tHe didn't want
      to be a footsoldier, so he requested a transfer to the navy and was able to
      start flight training on December 1, 1941. A week later the Japanese bombed
      Pearl Harbor, commencing the U.S.'s involvement in World War II, so Raschio
      went through his training and ended up being sent to Cherry Point Marine Base
      in North Carolina. There he flew 'dawn patrol' up and down the Atlantic coast
      hoping to catch submarines when they surfaced.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tWhen Raschio returned to Portland on leave, he found that
      his soon-to-be wife, Maria, had organized everything for their wedding, and
      he was married to her during his two week stay before reporting back for his
      military service.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tEventually
      Raschio was commissioned to a heavy cruiser in Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed
      around through the Panama Canal to its homeport of San Francisco. From there
      the ship became involved in the WWII fight for the Marshall Islands. He risked
      his life many times while aboard, surviving hurricanes and monsoons that tossed
      the cruiser in every direction, and flying reconnaissance missions in small
      planes catapulted off the deck of the ship.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tOn one of these missions, when flying over an enemy island,
      Raschio noticed a small track leading away from the airstrip. To get a closer
      look, he flew down to an altitude of 500 feet, all while evading enemy fire,
      and saw that the track led to a building that he could only presume must be
      an ammunition dump, strategically placed away from the airfield to avoid U.S.
      bombing. Immediately after landing, he reported to the General Quarters of the
      friendly ship that retrieved him, showing the commander where to fire the ship's
      guns in an attempt to hit the building.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tAs stated in the USS Hale historical records, \"The highlight
      of this week, which even now is unsurpassed, was that fuel dump the Hale touched

      to Portland, Raschio wasted no time in getting the job that he had always sought
      in Portland's public school system. He was hired as a science teacher at Franklin
      High School in 1945, and taught for 36 years before retiring in 1980. Though
      the stories might not be as hair-raising as those of the war, the memories of
      Franklin are fond.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \t\"Franklin

      who only show up once a week, maybe not even that,\" he explains. So when he
      flunked the entire class but for one person who earned a D, he simply gave them
      the crying towel. \"I said 'I have done everything I can for you, and this is
      the best I can do,'\" Raschio recalls.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tAfter retiring from teaching, Dario Raschio returned to Saint
      Michael's Parish as an usher, serving his Italian Catholic community that has
      preserved with the downtown Portland church as its anchor. His wife passed away
      in 2010, but he continues to embrace the life with which he has been graced,
      most recently with the tumult of celebration surrounding his 100th birthday.\n
      \               </p>"
    - "<p>\n                \tThe house on the Willamette riverfront in which retired
      Franklin science teacher Dario Raschio was born has been demolished for years,
      but Saint Michael's Parish still stands just a quarter mile west, surrounded
      by the tall gray buildings that now make up downtown Portland. This is where
      Raschio was baptized, had his First Communion, and where his children and grandchildren
      have been baptized as well.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tRaschio
      celebrated his 100th birthday on November 10, his church outdating him by about
      20 years, having been founded in 1894 by Italian Catholic immigrants. Portland's
      'Little Italy' neighborhood, where Raschio grew up. has since been developed
      almost to the point of being unrecognizable, but Saint Michael the Archangel
      Catholic Parish serves as a reminder of the area's history.\n                </p>\n

      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tAfter attending
      grade school at St. Michael's, Raschio went to St. Stephen's High School in
      SE Portland, where he remembers playing baseball against Franklin. After high
      school, he enrolled in the pharmacy program at North Pacific College, but transferred
      to OSU a year later, switching into the PreMed program, and ultimately into
      teaching.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tIt was
      difficult to find work in the heart of the Great Depression, and Raschio applied
      for all kinds of jobs across the state before finally getting a letter granting
      him an interview for a teaching position in Gold Beach, OR. At the same time,
      he received a telegram offering him a job as a government clerk in Washington,
      D.C. The job in Gold Beach would have only paid $85 a month, while the job being
      handed to him in D.C. paid $100 a month, so Raschio traveled across the country
      to the capital. Two years later, in September 1941, a gathering was held in
      D.C. where the names of ten men were drawn for the ceremonial part of the army
      draft.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \t\"Guess
      who was one of the ten? Lucky me,\" Raschio jokes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tHe didn't want to be a footsoldier, so he requested a transfer
      to the navy and was able to start flight training on December 1, 1941. A week
      later the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, commencing the U.S.'s involvement in
      World War II, so Raschio went through his training and ended up being sent to
      Cherry Point Marine Base in North Carolina. There he flew 'dawn patrol' up and
      down the Atlantic coast hoping to catch submarines when they surfaced.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tWhen Raschio returned to Portland on
      leave, he found that his soon-to-be wife, Maria, had organized everything for
      their wedding, and he was married to her during his two week stay before reporting
      back for his military service.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tEventually Raschio was commissioned to a heavy cruiser in
      Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed around through the Panama Canal to its homeport
      of San Francisco. From there the ship became involved in the WWII fight for
      the Marshall Islands. He risked his life many times while aboard, surviving
      hurricanes and monsoons that tossed the cruiser in every direction, and flying
      reconnaissance missions in small planes catapulted off the deck of the ship.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tOn one of these
      missions, when flying over an enemy island, Raschio noticed a small track leading
      away from the airstrip. To get a closer look, he flew down to an altitude of
      500 feet, all while evading enemy fire, and saw that the track led to a building
      that he could only presume must be an ammunition dump, strategically placed
      away from the airfield to avoid U.S. bombing. Immediately after landing, he
      reported to the General Quarters of the friendly ship that retrieved him, showing
      the commander where to fire the ship's guns in an attempt to hit the building.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tAs stated in the

      Sloan boutique are both great places to find affordable and stylish winter fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere

      Angeles surfboard designer Shawn Stussy, in the early 1980's, released a line
      of t-shirts with his surfboard logo, \"Stussy\" on the front. He started by
      selling the shirts out of the back of his van on boardwalks, but as the iconic
      design grew, the birth of a fashion style that would forever change the industry
      occurred: Streetwear.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Streetwear is a hard to define term, as
      it is such a broad market. While you can see streetwear brands everywhere, the
      core concept behind its popularity is \"exclusiveness.\" The idea of buying
      clothing that has a limited stock has attracted a huge following. But what many
      don't see is the source pushing the product, Hip-Hop.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLook at
      any famous rapper from 1980 till now. The style that an artist wears plays a
      big part in their image. Notorious B.I.G., for example, referenced clothing
      companies in many of his verses, like \"I put h**s in NY onto DKNY, Miami, D.C.
      prefer Versace.\" Sporting high-end brands has always been a statement of wealth
      and power. Jewelry and clothing from brands such as Gucci, Versace, Dolce &amp;
      Gabbana, and Timberland have been an icon in Hip-Hop. Artists had their own
      special trend that stuck with their following; Wu-tang Clan and Carhart, Biggie
      and DKNY. But as inflation kicked in, and the economic class widened, Hip-Hop
      looked for a more DIY market to push.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2003, Pharrell, lead
      emcee of Rap-rock band N.E.R.D, started wearing around a t-shirt with a camo
      Ape Stencil and the words, \"A Bathing Ape.\" The brand, created by Japanese
      Designer Nigo, gained a rapid following. Artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne,
      and Kid Cudi, started sporting the brand. Soon the company would plant themselves
      as one of the most recognizable brands in streetwear fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOdd
      Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, the LA-based rap collective led by rapper Tyler
      the Creator, had a huge influence in the streetwear world. They caught the music
      industry's attention for their explicit, violent, and rude humor that attracted
      the liking of many teens. The group gave themselves an image, which greatly
      helped local clothing company Supreme. Odd Future constantly wore the brands
      iconic \"box logo\" tee in many performances and interviews. As they gained
      popularity, so did Supreme. Due to the company's size, many of their lines had
      a limited number of prints, giving each item even more hype. While Odd Future
      has now started their own brand, and doesn't work with Supreme, the LA brand
      is still in the spotlight of street fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, one
      of the biggest names in the Hip-Hop industry, Kanye West. He has always been
      a landmark figure in the fashion industry. His portfolio is massive. He has
      landed deals to design for A.P.C, Adidas, and his most famous Nike Air Yeezy's,
      which have been listed on Ebay for as much as 16.3 million dollars. He has helped
      create the style of \"Street-Goth,\" which has recently been a growing style
      in Hip-Hop culture. West continues to make a name in the fashion world, recently
      selling a plain white t-shirt for $120.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere will Hip-Hop take
      fashion next? That is a question that is on most streetwear designers minds.
      As of now, it has taken a turn. A$ap Rocky, the New York emcee and front man
      for A$ap Mob, recently released a single in which he calls out prominent streetwear
      brands Been Trill and Hood By Air for not giving him credit for representing
      their brands. This created a hot discussion among fans of the brand on many
      fashion forums. For now, the drama has settled, but this could start problems
      for both the brands and the artists who represent it. Hip-Hop has always made
      a long standing impact on many businesses, whether it be cars, alcohol, or clothing.
      The future of fashion is unknown, but wherever it goes, Hip-Hop will always
      be involved.\n</p>"

    - '"I like how it brings everyone together."'
    - "<p>\n                \tOne of Franklin's many annual traditions is Powderpuff,
      a fundraiser football game for the senior class where the players are girls
      and the cheerleaders are guys. Powderpuff not only allows for camaraderie between
      the male and female athletes, but also for fun in an unconventional way.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tHannah Horten (12), participated both
      this year and last year. \"I really like the team element, I like how it brings
      everyone together, and everyone on your team is totally supporting you and wants
      to win, even if you've never talked before,\" she said.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tThe game is open to only junior and senior
      girls, all of whom are volunteers. They are coached by male members of the football
      team who are also volunteers. The limited demographic distills the competitive
      nature of the game, putting pressure on the seniors to uphold an unspoken tradition,
      and win in their last year.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tJeffrey
      Smith (12) looked forward to seeing the seniors show their dominance both physically
      and mentally on the field, but he felt that the spirit of the game might be
      compromised by the expectation of winning. \"I think actually they might be
      at a disadvantage because I think they're so psyched out about winning,\" he
      said. \"Some of them are going to be focused on winning, and not really focused
      on the set plays and actually what it takes to work.\"\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tThis is something that Horten has found
      as well. \"It can get really aggressive and intense at points but overall it's
      really exciting,\" she said.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tThis
      game was a lot closer than previous years; not one team dominated the game.
      After the juniors tied the seniors at 22 points in the fourth quarter the seniors
      rallied together and won.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tPowderpuff
      is not only a fun game, some view it as a way to switch the gender roles and
      gain some understanding of what the other gender experiences.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t\"Powderpuff shows guys that cheer is
      actually hard,\" said Tanna Haney (11), a cheerleader. \"Powderpuff shows our
      school what it is to be in different roles, like the boys cheering, because
      at Franklin, you can cheer if you're a guy, but no one does it, and you can
      also play football at Franklin if you're a girl, but no one does that either,
      so it's just showing them that they could do it and how much fun it would be.\"\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \tHorten is not so
      sure. \"I don't know if it actually does a whole lot for gender roles,\" she
      said. However, the girls who play Powderpuff gain some respect from the guys,
      and many become friends.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                \tOlivia
      Wilk (12) believes it brings \"new perspectives. I think people who have these
      confined views about how women can't play football, they recognize through this
      game that women actually can,\" she said. \"It allows females to play a sport
      that is usually dominated by males.\"\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tFelix Graham (11) agreed. \"It's a nice equalizer,\" he said.
      Whether or not Powderpuff loosens preconceptions about gender roles in football
      is another question. \"I think subconsciously it does. I think people see guys
      running around being cheerleaders, and a bunch of girls running around playing
      football and they think this is a great time to be had.\"\n                </p>"

      confined views about how women can't play football, they recognize through this
      game that women actually can,\" she said. \"It allows females to play a sport
      that is usually dominated by males.\"\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tFelix Graham (11) agreed. \"It's a nice equalizer,\" he said.
      Whether or not Powderpuff loosens preconceptions about gender roles in football
      is another question. \"I think subconsciously it does. I think people see guys
      running around being cheerleaders, and a bunch of girls running around playing
      football and they think this is a great time to be had.\"\n                </p>"
    - One of Franklin's many annual traditions is Powderpuff, a fundraiser football
      game for the senior class where the players are girls and the cheerleaders are
      guys. Powderpuff not only allows for camaraderie between the male and female
      athletes, but also for fun in an unconventional way.

    - Cross Country Finishes Season Strong
    - Franklin cross country is getting ready to come back even stronger for track
      season.
    - "<p>\n        \tAfter a season full of learning experiences, the cross country
      team is looking forward to next season. Henry Mong, the only mens' state qualifier
      stated, \"I think it was a good season. In the beginning we were the clear underdogs.
      We would have had to have a perfect day to have gone to state as a team. The
      district meet was hard and a little frustrating that we didn't make it, but
      it was a good learning experience with great competition.\"\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t With a few easy weeks to rest from the season, the cross
      country team will pick up training again to get ready for track.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \t\"It is really good to see the freshmen sticking with
      it and going on runs because they enjoy it. Some people will be doing indoor
      winter track in January and February, then in the spring we will all come out
      for track. We will run throughout the summer in preparation for next year's
      season,\" Mong said.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t This year the boys'
      cross country team did not qualify for state but had a good showing at districts.
      The team is confident that the freshmen will continue to develop and that there
      will be a strong junior and senior class presence next season.\n        </p>"

    - "<p>\n\tIt was raining. Of course it was Oregon, but even so, it usually didn't
      rain <em>this</em> much. The rain misted as it bounced off the sidewalk, thoroughly
      soaking my shoes. Grimacing, I stepped into the deluge and was immediately deafened
      by the sound of the rain as it pounded my rain jacket. The huge Douglas fir
      tree by my house benevolently spread its furry needles, creating an umbrella;
      but I couldn't stay sheltered. The bus doesn't wait if you are late.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI
      crossed the wet street and stood next to the stop, watching the water droplets
      slither down my sleeve and plunge onto the sidewalk. My breath looked like an
      ancient dragon's smoke. The rain seeped through my jacket, and I shivered from
      the cold and damp. <em>This bus better come soon</em>, I thought anxiously,
      <em>preferably before I get completely soaked.</em> A sudden gust of wind flung
      icy droplets at my face. I got the feeling that the rain didn't like me, which
      was silly really. Just as another raindrop hit me-\n</p>\n<p>\n\t I woke up,
      gasping. I had the strangest sense of menace… as if something in my dream had
      been chasing me. An owl hooted, and I jumped. Then I remembered. I was lost
      in the forest, on a backpacking trip.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Get ahold of yourself!\"
      I could just barely see by the light of the crisp fall moon. It had started
      to rain; I looked up, another droplet landed on my forehead. I shivered, and
      not just from the cold, I was scared; terrified actually. <em>Why did I have
      to get lost</em>? I asked myself despairingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEverything went
      south by day two. I wasn't too pleased by the rain when I'd woken up, but like
      I said, this is Oregon. Folding up the tent after breakfast, I entered the trail.
      A while later, I pulled out the satellite phone (to call my boyfriend) when
      I tripped over a root. The phone broke when it landed in a puddle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"No!\"
      <em>This is bad, very bad</em>, I thought worriedly. I quickly checked myself,
      and was glad to find, injury-free. The phone was my bigger concern. If I got
      into trouble, I'd be all alone.. In my panic, I had to turn back and got lost
      along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDay five dawned cold and gray. I had three more
      meals worth of food, but my main problem was exposure. With no tent, all I had
      was a cheap sleeping bag. Now I was in a state of perma-dampness. It was still
      dark, around five a.m. And suddenly, like an unwelcome beast, the rain returned
      with vengeance. I shivered, and as if it sensed my weakness, it stole my warmth.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPacking
      up my sleeping bag, I set off on the trail, ignoring the rain. But the rain
      didn't want to be ignored. Two or three hours later, the rain had increased
      in tempo, and the wind seemed intent on blowing me into the ground. I was starting
      to become distressed. I was even more lost now than before. I slipped in the
      mud and had just stood when the sky split in two with a terrible peal of thunder.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith
      a terrified cry I ran from the rain as it roared to life, surging toward me.
      It took the shape of a serpent, and slithered closer…and closer… and closer.
      It spit, and water droplets hit my face. I bolted away, but slipped, and the
      rain loomed over me. I closed my eyes and-\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was in my room, my
      real room, awake this time.<em> Must have been the cold medicine</em>, I thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t'Oh,
      I didn't mean to wake you. I was just changing the cloth on your forehead,\"
      said my mom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t \"Mom? I just had the weirdest dream! I was waiting
      at the bus stop, and then I was lost in a forest!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Mom?\" I
      asked. A sudden chill overcame me. She was gone. My gaze roved over the room,

      her eyelids. From behind her, Benjamin shook himself and water splattered against
      her back. A small, wooden signpost marked the turnoff. With a splash, Aster
      veered off the highway and on to the narrow dirt road. A rabbit darted across
      the path and Benjamin growled softly, wriggling in the cart.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tThe old lady's house stood at the base of a grand oak
      tree, which drooped and swayed in the wind, branches creaking. The house had
      been there so long that the tree had grown around it, its trunk breaking the
      walls and its branches poking through the roof. Even from where Aster was standing
      she could hear the house groaning beneath the behemoth's weight, and she could
      smell its herbs and molds and powders and poultices. Benjamin eagerly leaped
      from the cart and ran ahead, ignoring the fat black sheep which grazed on patches
      of cropped shrubbery. Aster reached the wide, wooden door and knocked. It swung
      open, hinges screeching, and silhouetted in the yellow light of the doorway,
      stood the hag. She was somewhere in her mid-sixties, but looked much older,
      her skin wrinkled and weathered from the sun, her hair brilliant-silver, wild,

      the battlefield. They were well trained, breaking the ranks of their enemies

      the Holy Trinity Church in his home town of Stratford-upon-Avon, generates an

      were initially wary of allowing the construction of the power station on their
      property, they eventually agreed to the plan, on the grounds that the generator

      the remainder of the generated energy back to the city for a small profit.  The

      \                       \tEarlier that day, a Staten Island grand jury announced
      its decision to not indict the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner
      on July 17. The incident, which was recorded on video, showed an NYPD officer
      putting Garner into an illegal chokehold and tackling him to the ground as he
      tried to let the officer know he couldn't breathe. The verdict from the jury
      immediately angered many Americans who felt justice was not served. A tsunami
      of social media posts about the incident flooded the internet. Just weeks after

      the city, starting the night of the verdict. From Times Square to the Brooklyn
      Bridge, people bombarded the streets in anger. Some took stronger action: blocking
      freeways, vandalizing property, and instigating riots. In one incident, police
      tried to arrest a man for throwing a trash can towards the police escorts on
      the Brooklyn Bridge. As two officers tried to detain the man, they were surrounded
      and assaulted by a group of protesters. Others chose to express their first
      amendment right, walking only on the sidewalk, chanting and yelling slogans
      such as \"No Justice, No Peace,\" or \"I Can't Breathe.\" Dozens of arrests

      almost every day. In the Big Apple, groups have gathered nightly since December

    - "<p>\n\tLooking for an exciting adventure book? Then <em>The Living</em>, by
      Matt De La Peña is your answer. The main character is Shy, a half Mexican teen
      working a simple summer job on a cruise ship, although his life is far from
      care-free. His grandmother died from Romero's disease, and now his nephew has
      it too. He witnessed a suicide and now someone is watching him. Shy once was
      only concerned for his family, until a massive earthquake that's been predicted
      to hit the West coast occurs and sends multiple tsunamis towards his cruise
      ship. Now Shy aims to get back to his family in California, survive the storm,
      and unravel the mysteries of Romero's disease, which has been plaguing his family.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis
      book features strong characters, Shy being one of the strongest. The evolution
      of Shy's character is what makes him so interesting and relatable. At the beginning,
      he is a regular teen whose only concern is if his salary will \"be enough to
      help his mom out and still score some new gear and a pair of kicks, maybe take
      a female out to dinner\" (1). At the book's conclusion, he is a toughened survivor;
      Shy has to beat up a shark with an oar to save his food. Not to mention, his
      only company is fellow survivor, Addie.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother great aspect of
      the book is the suspense; De La Peña keeps the reader wondering what will happen
      next. One of the best examples from the book is when Shy is waiting for the
      second tsunami wave to hit and he \"saw a second rise in the distance, this
      one building farther out and already more massive, and he knew immediately they
      wouldn't make it over\" (147).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Living</em> is not lacking
      a good plot either, because once Shy has time to talk to Addie, he discovers
      her father could have part of the answer to Romero's disease. I enjoyed going
      along for the ride as Shy uncovered the truth about his survival and Romero's
      disease. Overall, I recommend <em>The Living</em> for its suspense, character
      development and interesting plot.\n</p>"

    - EU Parliament Votes to Divide Google Search Engine, Other Services
    - ''
    - "<p>\n                \tOn November 27, 2014, the European Parliament passed
      a measure to break up Google, the company behind the world's most popular search
      engine. The vote is nonbinding, meaning it cannot be enforced as law, but it's
      the latest event in a series of disagreements between Google and the European
      Union (EU) regarding the latter's policies on the handling of citizens' data

      the oven, using the end of a broomstick to prod at its massive underbelly. She
      could hear the small man laughing and see him scuttling around when she pressed
      her eye to the floor. It was growing dark and Ms. Black had long since retired
      to her room. Benjamin snored from his spot by the fire.\n                                </p>\n

      out, man. I just want to talk,\" Aster said, casting aside the broom. \"See?
      No weapons, it's a fair fight.\" The little man snorted in response and drops
      of saliva flew from beneath the stove, hitting Aster in the face. Recoiling,
      she leaned back on her ankles and rose from the floor. She began pushing the
      oven, and grunting, she turned, pressing her back against its cast-iron side.
      The thing was at least three times her weight, and the effort caused her to
      fall backwards against a tall, teetering shelf which held an array of small
      glass jars. The shelf wobbled slightly, causing several of the jars to fall,
      and a spray of glass spattered like rainfall across the floor. Aster looked
      up from the floor and watched as a tendril of pink smoke rose upward and curled
      around her feet. The smoke tickled around her thighs and made its way up her
      legs, bringing with it a burning, fuzzy sensation. Aster found that her head
      was heavy and her limbs were weakened. Eyes drooping, Aster saw the little man
      silhouetted against the bright light of the fire, shaking with laughter, before

      opened her eyes and was faced with the sight of a great, looming mass of darkness
      with curving sides. All around her were strangely shaped, clear, jagged objects,
      and semi transparent pink liquid, which glinted in the light of a vast pillar
      of flame. Aster's first thought was that the old woman's house was on fire;
      she had blacked out from sheer exhaustion and the fire had caught upon some
      stray dust speck, or perhaps a clump of Benjamin's hair. Aster rose to her feet,
      and discovered that she was covered in the thick, pink liquid, which was sticky
      and sweetly-scented. Quite suddenly she found herself smothered by a massive
      wet object. Rousing herself, she turned and was faced with an enormous furry
      snout and a pair of smiling teeth.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n

      licked Aster once again; the entirety of his tongue was nearly half the size
      of her body and the severity of the licking knocked her from her feet. Fortunately,
      the dog seemed to recognize Aster as a friend and was not making an attempt
      to eat her, however it had become apparent to her that she was tiny, and a clear
      target for less-forgiving creatures. Benjamin's ears pricked up and he began
      to emit a low, menacing growl which reverberated the air and sent shivers down
      Aster's spine. From across the room came a shriek, and a stampede of small,
      ravaged men came tumbling towards Aster. Benjamin planted himself in front of
      Aster, forming a massive canine shield as the men neared her location. Soon
      the air filled with Benjamin's howling and the indistinguishable chanting of
      the group.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \t\"Stop it, all of you, now!\" Cutting through
      the silence, was Ms. Black. She was ordinarily rather small in stature, but
      now towered leagues above Aster, and with broom in hand, she was frightening.\n
      \                               </p>\n                                <p>\n

    - "<p>\n                                \tAster crouched on the floor next to
      the oven, using the end of a broomstick to prod at its massive underbelly. She
      could hear the small man laughing and see him scuttling around when she pressed
      her eye to the floor. It was growing dark and Ms. Black had long since retired
      to her room. Benjamin snored from his spot by the fire.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                \t \"Come
      out, man. I just want to talk,\" Aster said, casting aside the broom. \"See?
      No weapons, it's a fair fight.\" The little man snorted in response and drops
      of saliva flew from beneath the stove, hitting Aster in the face. Recoiling,
      she leaned back on her ankles and rose from the floor. She began pushing the
      oven, and grunting, she turned, pressing her back against its cast-iron side.
      The thing was at least three times her weight, and the effort caused her to
      fall backwards against a tall, teetering shelf which held an array of small
      glass jars. The shelf wobbled slightly, causing several of the jars to fall,
      and a spray of glass spattered like rainfall across the floor. Aster looked
      up from the floor and watched as a tendril of pink smoke rose upward and curled
      around her feet. The smoke tickled around her thighs and made its way up her
      legs, bringing with it a burning, fuzzy sensation. Aster found that her head
      was heavy and her limbs were weakened. Eyes drooping, Aster saw the little man
      silhouetted against the bright light of the fire, shaking with laughter, before
      drifting off into oblivion.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n

      youth, many of whom wanted to rebel against any issue they could find. They
      grew out their hair, wore taboo clothing, and listened to nothing but rock.
      As the era of peace and love came to an end, so did the world wide music phenomenon
      which inspired kids throughout the decades. The rapid advancements in technology
      drove rock and roll straight into the ground. As the music industry turned digital,

      of the keyboard and drum machine. It became wildly popular in European countries
      in the 90's. A slow underground movement started to form in North America and

      performance at the Coachella music festival was regarded by the legendary music
      magazine <em>Spin</em> as the \"tipping point\" in the evolution of the electronic
      music era. Soon, dj's such as Deadmau5 and David Guetta began receiving national
      attention for their chart topping remixes and heart-pounding shows. Music labels
      and concert promoters caught on to the trend. Electronic shows, known mainly
      as \"raves,\" brought in huge crowds who would buy multiple drinks and stay
      till one or two in the morning. Promoters started hosting more and more electronic
      shows in prominent clubs and high-capacity venues. The outcome was beyond successful.\n

      Soundcloud have provided a huge outlet for up-and-coming producers and dj's
      to gain headway into the industry. It has also helped many festivals and concerts
      receive extra attention. Tomorrowland, the annual 3 day electronic music festival
      held in Belgium, has received endless promotion from Youtube. The festival's
      2011 \"Official Aftermovie,\" a 20 minute montage of concert footage and festival
      attendees, has almost 70 million views. Then in 2013, all of the tickets sold

      attendance and over 86 million views on the aftermovie. The attendance at Tomorrowland

      is approximately between the ages of 13-30. The popularity of clubs and raves
      has also caused a significant rise in drug use, similar to the drug problem
      in the 60's. There is a growing culture behind the genre too; many fans dress
      in neon colors, sporting bracelets and light-up accessories. EDM has taken over
      a majority of radio play, been the main focus of the music industry, and is
      played in most stores and supermarkets as if it were elevator music. Electronic

      last season where they made it to the second round of the playoffs for the first
      time in 14 years. The Blazers are poised for another playoffs sitting atop their
      conference. Still, the season is far from over, and with injuries starting to

      brought the team closer to a championship than any coach in the past 14 years.
      Stotts took over from Nate McMillan in 2012, and started to rebuild the program.

      points per-game. Lillard has had some important game-winning shots, most notably

      \               \tThe addition of Damian Lillard raised the Trailblazers to

    - Public Wi-Fi to Expand in New York City
    - ''
    - "<p>\n                        \tNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced
      an ambitious new project to bring Wi-Fi access to the entire city. The plan
      would involve placing kiosks, with free domestic calling and advertisements,
      all across the city that broadcast a Wi-Fi hotspot to which users can connect
      their devices.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n                        \tThe project,
      called LinkNYC, is expected to cost about $200 million and bring up to 10,000
      kiosks to the city over the next 12 to 15 years. The internet stations would
      provide one of the fastest connections available to consumers in the United
      States, with speeds up to one gigabit per second.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \                       \tThe plan is for the kiosks to offer a seamless experience
      throughout the city. Once a user signs up and connects to the kiosks with their
      device(s), they will stay connected. If they move out of the range of one kiosk,
      they will automatically connect to the next one within range.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n                        \tAlong with free gigabit Wi-Fi service
      and domestic phone calls, the LinkNYC kiosks will also provide access to a \"touchscreen
      tablet interface\" to access the city's services and get directions and a free
      charging station for mobile devices.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n                        \tMayor
      de Blasio's office has said that they will not forget the poorer parts of NYC.\n

      plan, Senator Kevin Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat, doesn't believe it's enough,
      \"A limited amount of free Wi-Fi…is a step toward closing the technology gap,
      but…more needs to be done to provide reliable broadband to all,\" he said.\n

      plan to bring such widespread internet access to the city yet. The last big
      push was made by MetroFi, a project abandoned by the city after six months in
      2007. The de Blasio administration is hoping the LinkNYC proposal, which is
      now awaiting approval by NYC's Franchise and Concession Review Committee, will
      inspire other cities to follow.\n        </p>"

    - "<p>\n                \t\"If we burn, you burn with us.\" This quote sums up
      the theme of <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1</em>. The movie is about
      rebellion against the corrupt government in a dystopian post-apocalyptic world.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \t<em>Mockingjay</em>
      was directed by Francis Lawrence the third movie based on the trilogy of novels
      written by Suzanne Collins. Written by Suzanne Collins, the series is set in
      a world of turmoil. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl
      at the head of an uprising against the authoritarian powers in The Capitol.
      Simultaneously, Katniss also must decide who she is in love with: her long time
      friend and protector, Gale, ( Liam Hemsworth) or Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the
      boy who Katniss met in the first movie and fought with against The Capitol (the
      government of the society in which the series is set). `\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t<em>Mockingjay</em> is currently the
      third highest grossing movie in the North American box offices this year, and
      it is soon predicted to reach number two.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tConstant action. Although there was less fighting overall,
      there was never a dull moment; the intense and convincing performance by Jennifer
      Lawrence had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Lawrence
      expertly portrayed the strong feelings of sadness and anger that Katniss felt.
      This installment of <em>The Hunger Games</em> had a much higher budget than
      it's two predecessors, which made the action scenes more intense. Despite the
      lack of fighting scenes, it was actually more engaging because the protests
      against the government seemed more relevant to the current situation in the
      world. The movie also delved deeper into the main characters' personalities
      by having more scenes filled with conversation as opposed to action.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tOverall, Mockingjay is a suspenseful

    - "<p>\n                \t\"If we burn, you burn with us.\" This quote sums up
      the theme of <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1</em>. The movie is about
      rebellion against the corrupt government in a dystopian post-apocalyptic world.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                \t<em>Mockingjay</em>
      was directed by Francis Lawrence the third movie based on the trilogy of novels
      written by Suzanne Collins. Written by Suzanne Collins, the series is set in
      a world of turmoil. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl
      at the head of an uprising against the authoritarian powers in The Capitol.
      Simultaneously, Katniss also must decide who she is in love with: her long time
      friend and protector, Gale, ( Liam Hemsworth) or Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the
      boy who Katniss met in the first movie and fought with against The Capitol (the
      government of the society in which the series is set). `\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \t<em>Mockingjay</em> is currently the
      third highest grossing movie in the North American box offices this year, and
      it is soon predicted to reach number two.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n
      \               \tConstant action. Although there was less fighting overall,
      there was never a dull moment; the intense and convincing performance by Jennifer
      Lawrence had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Lawrence
      expertly portrayed the strong feelings of sadness and anger that Katniss felt.
      This installment of <em>The Hunger Games</em> had a much higher budget than
      it's two predecessors, which made the action scenes more intense. Despite the
      lack of fighting scenes, it was actually more engaging because the protests
      against the government seemed more relevant to the current situation in the
      world. The movie also delved deeper into the main characters' personalities
      by having more scenes filled with conversation as opposed to action.\n                </p>\n
      \               <p>\n                \tOverall, Mockingjay is a suspenseful
      and highly entertaining movie that is worth seeing. It is currently playing
      at most Regal Cinemas and at The Bagdad Theater.\n                </p>"

      Football Bowl games grows and grows, and this year is no exception. With the
      addition of the College Football Playoff, the number swelled to 39 games. That
      number would cause any psychic to balk at predicting every outcome, but that
      didn't stop many of Franklin's staff from attempting to do just that.\n                        </p>\n

      Bash has taken place, and despite the larger number of outcomes –the number
      of bowl games has more than doubled in that span–, the rivalry between teachers
      is as fierce as ever. The organizer of the competition, Tom McCarthy(also known
      as Coach Mac), has never done better than third place, but he's still a fierce
      competitor. His true goal is not to have bragging rights over every participant,
      but just one in particular, his fellow teacher Rick Holte. Holte was not afraid
      to admit that the feeling was mutual. \"I want him to finish last. Worst case
      scenario, I finish one above him, best case scenario I win it all,\" said Holte.\n

      of the competitors see it as just a friendly competition. Of course, they each
      want to come out on top, but at the end of the day, it's just a chance to compete
      amongst each other. McCarthy understands this, and also that it can be an important
      bonding activity for the staff.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n

      for a while, and it's just a fun bonding activity.\" When you talk to either
      of the main orchestrators of the Bowl Bash, Holte or McCarthy, you are often

      back down to earth. The boys basketball team is currently sitting at a record
      of 4-6 after dropping two of their first three, including the league opener
      to Lincoln 49-69. At the beginning of the season, the team relied on their center
      Joseph Shmoyer (11) for baskets, as he scored over twenty points multiple times

      past month. You can hear it in the basketballs bouncing on open court, or in
      students commenting that they didn''t even realize that Franklin had a swimming
      team. Most importantly, you can smell it by even being near the wrestling room
      for too long. It''s that time of year again—winter sports are here.        '

    - "<p>\n                        \tAnisa Nokham (10) is a visual artist, who is
      a big fan of video games and hot cocoa. Nokham started drawing with generic
      Anime references in order for her to improve and to make different kinds of
      art. Now she uses digital drawing tools, but still draws without specific software.\n
      \               </p>\n                <p>\n                                \tNokham's
      favorite style of art is semi realism, but she dabbles in other styles as well.
      \"I like to do semi realism drawing, occasionally an Anime-like style, sometimes
      chibi. But semi realism is my main style,\" Nokham said. Her writing utensil
      of choice is the Paper Mate Clearpoint® 0.5 Black Mechanical Pencil. \"I use
      them because they bring a nice, firm feeling to my hand. I like to have something
      that's nice and strong to keep my hand stable with when drawing,\" said Nokham.
      Nokham's inspiration comes from her best friend, Angela Chanthavong. \"She loved
      to draw, and would frequently invite me along to draw as well.\" Nokham said.
      Her best piece is a drawing of her original character Ray, a royal prince. Nokham
      likes the piece because she feels that it depicts Ray's elegance, and his royal
      personality.  Nokham credits her drawing skills to the right side of the brain,
      because it's filled with creative, imaginative, intuitive, and heuristic thoughts.
      To see Nokham's drawings, she can be found at Luna's Painting Studio on Fridays.\n

    - "<p>\n                                \tOn November 20, President Barack Obama
      passed his rumored executive order regarding the issue of immigration reform.
      Obama pledged to take his own legislative action before the end of 2014, because
      of the constant gridlock within Congress during the past few years of his term.\n
      \                               </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tThe new executive order did not have to pass
      through Congress; President Obama only had to sign it to put it into law for
      the rest of his term. Executive orders are not as common as federal legislation,
      because Congress can usually come to a compromise on issues. The exception is
      when party members in the houses stay steadfast to their principles, creating
      partisan gridlock. Obama's executive order on immigration will affect close
      to 5 million immigrants who are now in America, and includes three main objectives
      to make immigration safer and fairer for everyone involved.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                \tThe first
      action that Obama wants to take is to enhance the security at the border in
      order to prevent further illegal immigration to the United States. In terms
      of deporting illegal immigrants already in the United States, the order prioritizes
      criminals, not families, and allows the undocumented immigrants who are contributing
      to society economically to stay.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tThe final item that President Obama included
      in the order was the placement of criminal and background checks for undocumented
      children of U.S. citizens, who have been living in the United States for at
      least five years. With proper test results, the children are allowed to stay
      in the United States, without repercussions, if temporarily. President Obama
      looks to have immigrants positively impact the economy, and become loyal citizens
      through the existing naturalization system.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                \tThe executive
      order was not the only prominent political action that President Obama took
      regarding foreign policy. In December 2014, Obama decided not to sign, and therefore
      terminated, the embargo on trade with Cuba. The embargo has lasted for over
      five decades.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tCongress can repass the executive action into
      law to maintain the embargo and this seems to be the intention of the Republican-majority
      Congress. Both the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and
      the Speaker of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, have publicly criticized Obama's
      move to lift the embargo.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \t\"Relations with the Castro regime should
      not be revisited, let alone normalized, until the Cuban people enjoy freedom--and
      not one second sooner,\" said Boehner to USA Today, expressing his disappointment
      with Obama's decision.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n

      Obama pledged to take his own legislative action before the end of 2014, because
      of the constant gridlock within Congress during the past few years of his term.\n
      \                               </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tThe new executive order did not have to pass
      through Congress; President Obama only had to sign it to put it into law for
      the rest of his term. Executive orders are not as common as federal legislation,
      because Congress can usually come to a compromise on issues. The exception is
      when party members in the houses stay steadfast to their principles, creating
      partisan gridlock. Obama's executive order on immigration will affect close
      to 5 million immigrants who are now in America, and includes three main objectives
      to make immigration safer and fairer for everyone involved.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                \tThe first
      action that Obama wants to take is to enhance the security at the border in
      order to prevent further illegal immigration to the United States. In terms
      of deporting illegal immigrants already in the United States, the order prioritizes
      criminals, not families, and allows the undocumented immigrants who are contributing
      to society economically to stay.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tThe final item that President Obama included
      in the order was the placement of criminal and background checks for undocumented
      children of U.S. citizens, who have been living in the United States for at
      least five years. With proper test results, the children are allowed to stay
      in the United States, without repercussions, if temporarily. President Obama
      looks to have immigrants positively impact the economy, and become loyal citizens
      through the existing naturalization system.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                \tThe executive
      order was not the only prominent political action that President Obama took
      regarding foreign policy. In December 2014, Obama decided not to sign, and therefore
      terminated, the embargo on trade with Cuba. The embargo has lasted for over
      five decades.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tCongress can repass the executive action into
      law to maintain the embargo and this seems to be the intention of the Republican-majority
      Congress. Both the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and
      the Speaker of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, have publicly criticized Obama's
      move to lift the embargo.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \t\"Relations with the Castro regime should
      not be revisited, let alone normalized, until the Cuban people enjoy freedom--and
      not one second sooner,\" said Boehner to USA Today, expressing his disappointment
      with Obama's decision.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                               \tEntering the new year, a conflict between
      the Republican-majority Congress and the Democratic president seems on the horizon.\n
      \                               </p>"

      that would have required food manufacturers and retailers to label genetically
      modified foods, was officially defeated December 16, with the certification
      of a statewide, hand-recount of ballots. The final tally had the measure losing
      by an exceptionally slim margin of 837 votes, or about one twentieth of one
      percent of the total votes cast. The fate of the vote was shaped by the record-breaking
      spending of the 'No on 92 Coalition,' which ran fear-mongering TV attack ads,
      funded by agrochemical and food giants, to mislead voters and score a narrow
      defeat of the measure.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n

      December 11, after a judge ruled that he could not stop the count, despite 4,600
      votes that would not be counted due to issues with the signature on the ballot
      not matching the one the election office had on file. The campaign said in a
      statement, \"Given the razor-thin margin in this race, and the failure to count
      every valid ballot, we believe that Oregonians will never know for sure the
      true outcome of this race.\"\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n
      \                       \tWhile the defeat of Measure 92 is a harrowing loss
      in the fight against the monstrous domination of the agrochemical and food industries,
      the sheer closeness of the race is cause for optimism. The 'No' campaign raised
      a total of $21.9 million, 99.8% of which came from out-of-state, and 99.995%
      donated by business entities. By contrast, the 'Yes' campaign received $9.9
      million, 77.3% from out-of state, 40.5% from businesses. These numbers show
      exactly how bad the 'corporationization' of the election was. For me, this is
      reason enough to support GMO labeling initiatives. If Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer,
      PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dow AgroSciences, the top five donors to the No on 92
      Coalition, want to deprive the consumer of the right to know what is in their

      to look at these ads with a critical eye and understand how they are funded.
      The election was also a perfect example of how democracy doesn't work if you
      do not vote. Only 1.54 million Oregonians voted in the 2014 General Election,
      out of an estimated 2.98 million eligible voters. In comparison, 837 votes is
      next to nothing. A slight increase in voter turnout could easily have changed
      the outcome of this election. Activists will continue to push GMO labeling initiatives
      in the next few years, and young voters could very well make the difference
      in their outcomes. Remember, as you come of voting age, that though it may sound
      corny, every vote counts.\n                        </p>"

    - The story talks about loosing the election of ballot measure 92. The ballot
      measure was really close, which was why there so much controversy about it.
      Certain ballots were not able to be counted because they did not match the election
      office had on file.&nbsp;

      were held in cities across America in response to the deaths of Michael Brown,
      Erik Garner, and Tamir Rice at the hands of police officers, and the decision
      that the man who shot Brown will not face charges. While the topic of police
      violence in America has fallen out of the news, in part due to a positive government
      response, with measures to attempt to tackle the issue proposed at the state
      and federal level, and partially because it has been lost in the constant forward
      march of the 24 hour news cycle, looking back at the protests themselves raises
      some interesting questions.\n                                                        </p>\n

      Portland more than 3000 protesters began their march in front of the city's
      Justice Center on SW 3rd, and followed a route that snaked through downtown,
      holding signs, shouting chants, and stopping traffic. The slogans \"Black lives
      matter\" and \"Hands up don't shoot,\" both popularized by social media and
      heard at protests across the country, were featured prominently in Portland.\n

      by the Albina Ministerial Alliance, a coalition of predominantly African American
      churches form North and Northeast Portland. The group has a long history of
      activism dating back to the civil rights era, and police violence is currently
      their primary issue.\n                                                        </p>\n

      involvement of this historic group highlights a growing divide among activists
      in America. Most marchers present at the Ferguson rallies fell into one of two
      camps, the older generation who have been active in civil disobedience since
      the 60's and 70's, and a new, younger group, many of whom got their start in
      the Occupy movement.\n                                                        </p>\n

      of these long time activists are fiercely loyal to the idles of 20<sup>th</sup>
      century leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., and it's evident in the way this
      march was organized; gospel inspired songs like \"we will overcome,\" silent
      moments of remembrance, and a candle light vigil for the deceased call back
      to a bygone era of American activism, when the church was a hotbed of political
      activism for many black Americans.\n                                                        </p>\n

      large part younger protesters were not happy with the AMA's handling of the
      demonstration. They favor a more aggressive form of resistance, while still
      non-violent, in their eyes they seek to force change rather than ask for it.
      Perhaps the most telling event at the rallies occurred while the organizers
      attempted to lead the group in a rendition of we will overcome from the steps
      of the Justice Center many in the crowd voiced their displeasure by erupting
      into a chant of \"No justice no peace.\"\n                                                        </p>\n

      protestors in the audience expressed that we need to try new methods to reduce
      police brutality, the methods we had been using before are clearly not fixing
      the issue. The leaders voiced how that change has happened; we just need to
      be patient. But how long are we willing to wait? Although our next step is not
      entirely clear, trying new nonviolent movements is our next approach. Getting
      people off their phones and onto the streets is a great start.\n                                                        </p>\n

      People feel really strongly one way or another, but they are not willing to
      put themselves out there. Getting people voting and protesting is our only option
      right now. Getting people voting shows that we do not agree with the way those
      things are currently and we need to fix it. If you are not voting, you are saying
      that you are okay with the way things are being run in the government and nothing
      needs to change. Most people do not feel this way, they are simply just not
      educated enough that they feel inclined they will make a good decision when
      voting.\n                                                        </p>\n                                                        <p>\n

      ended roughly an hour after it began, but many felt there was still work to
      be done. Abandoning the church organizers, the pre-planned route, and the police
      escort many continued marching, eventually closing down the Burnside Bridge
      in protest.\n                                                        </p>\n

      choose to remain on the steps of the Justice Center, demanding answers from
      the organizers. \"You got us all together for an hour, gave a speech, and then
      told us to go home,\" shouted one demonstrator. While another I interviewed
      told me \"They gave everybody what they wanted, and they told us to go home.\"
      He continued, \"They were singing cumbia and all that bullshit, like everything's
      going to be okay, it's not going to be okay unless we act, and this isn't going
      to show anybody anything.\"\n                                                        </p>\n

      are less likely to vote. They are less likely to trust in established institutions,
      whether it's the government, or groups like AMA. Many feel disenfranchised,
      from politics that don't represent them, from schools that cost too much and
      deliver too little, and from political activist that give lofty speeches about

    - Franklin Constitution Team Takes Fifth at State
    - ''
    - "<p>\n        \tThe Franklin Maroon constitution team competed on Saturday,
      January 17 at the We the People state competition held at the Mark O. Hatfield
      Federal Courthouse in downtown Portland. Each unit participated in two mock
      congressional hearings before volunteer judges. Franklin placed fifth of the
      six teams that made it to state, with Grant taking first and advancing to the
      national competition, and Lincoln taking second.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tThough
      the team was disappointed that they did not place as high as expected, most
      were glad to have made it as far as they did.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \t\"I think
      I speak for all of us when I say we were just happy to have gotten the experience,\"
      said Grayson Perez (12), a member of Unit 1, which focuses on the philosophical
      foundations of the American political system. \"We are all happy that we do
      not have to… work for three more months, but we all wish we had gotten a little
      bit farther.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tIn an early survey taken in the class,
      the majority of Franklin AP Government students preferred that the team be split
      into JV and varsity. However, most of the students also assumed that they would
      be varsity competitors, so the decision was made to make the two teams equal.
      Some Franklin competitors wished that the team had been more selective and competitive,
      rather than emphasizing inclusiveness. At Grant and Lincoln, the only two schools
      to have won the Oregon State Competition since its inception in 1987, students
      must apply for the team, and 36 students are selected based on their essays,
      interviews, commitment, and academic standing. This process has produced some
      high achieving teams; Lincoln won the national title in 2012 and 2014, and Grant
      won in 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tCompeting at the State level, however, is
      nothing to be scoffed at. Franklin's team placed third at the state competition

    - "<p>\n        \tThe Franklin Maroon constitution team competed on Saturday,
      January 17 at the We the People state competition held at the Mark O. Hatfield
      Federal Courthouse in downtown Portland. Each unit participated in two mock
      congressional hearings before volunteer judges. Franklin placed fifth of the
      six teams that made it to state, with Grant taking first and advancing to the
      national competition, and Lincoln taking second.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tThough
      the team was disappointed that they did not place as high as expected, most
      were glad to have made it as far as they did.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \t\"I think
      I speak for all of us when I say we were just happy to have gotten the experience,\"
      said Grayson Perez (12), a member of Unit 1, which focuses on the philosophical
      foundations of the American political system. \"We are all happy that we do
      not have to… work for three more months, but we all wish we had gotten a little
      bit farther.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tIn an early survey taken in the class,
      the majority of Franklin AP Government students preferred that the team be split
      into JV and varsity. However, most of the students also assumed that they would
      be varsity competitors, so the decision was made to make the two teams equal.
      Some Franklin competitors wished that the team had been more selective and competitive,
      rather than emphasizing inclusiveness. At Grant and Lincoln, the only two schools
      to have won the Oregon State Competition since its inception in 1987, students
      must apply for the team, and 36 students are selected based on their essays,
      interviews, commitment, and academic standing. This process has produced some
      high achieving teams; Lincoln won the national title in 2012 and 2014, and Grant
      won in 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n        \tCompeting at the State level, however, is
      nothing to be scoffed at. Franklin's team placed third at the state competition
      last year, which was the highest Franklin had placed since it began sending
      teams to the competition in 2004. Students face esteemed judges, many of whom
      are actual judges, elected officials, attorneys, or other prominent figures.

    - A New Face for Marshall
    - PPS Rebrands and Renovates the Marshall Campus in Preparation for Franklin’s
      Arrival
    - "<p>\n                                                        \tAs Franklin
      prepares to make the big move to Marshall for the next two school years, PPS
      has been making improvements to the campus that will serve as a temporary home
      to Franklin and subsequently Grant. Using money from the same November 2012
      bond measure that is modernizing Franklin, PPS has constructed new sidewalks,
      crosswalks, and LED lighting in the Marshall parking lot. There have also been
      upgrades to the school building, including replacement of the fire alarm system
      ($1.35 million), interior painting, carpet and flooring replacement, and other
      various upgrades. Most of the upgrades to the Marshall Campus were completed
      in November, at an estimated total cost of $3.57 million.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tA
      new turf athletic field was also installed over the summer as part of the PPS
      Great Fields program. This $1.9 million project was not financed by the construction
      bond, but instead from a combination of Oregon School Construction Excise Tax
      revenues, a Nike sponsorship, and private university contributions.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      combined with the other improvements, this makes a total of about $5.5 million
      of recent improvements to Marshall. It is nowhere near the magnitude of Franklin's
      $82 million modernization, but some think it is a large sum considering that
      Marshall will only serve as a \"swing-site\" for four years, with no subsequent
      plans for the campus at present.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tTorrien
      Bruce (10) said that he dislikes the Marshall campus, and that it \"seems like
      a waste of money. For four years, I am sure the kids would be fine with the
      building not being that good, and then Franklin would be better when we got
      back.\" Others think it is worth the money to make minor improvements to Marshall.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      think that it is a good long term investment, because they are only using it
      for four years now, but they could use it again the future,\" said Daniel Frentress
      (11). \"There are still going to be students there for four years, so it is
      still important that it is nice and good enough to use.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tThe
      new sidewalks at Marshall provide a safer route to the school building from

      there is no dedicated space for pedestrians on the block between 92nd Avenue
      and the campus, but PPS is negotiating with the Portland Bureau of Transportation
      to create a safer environment on this street. There will be no additional yellow
      bus service to transport students to the campus, so many students will rely
      on walking, biking, or TriMet to get to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tIn
      November, Grant Magazine (Grant High School's student publication) <a href='http://grantmagazine.com/marshall/'>published
      an article</a> detailing concerns with their school's temporary move to Marshall
      in September 2017. Reporters found that moving Grant to the Marshall Campus
      was inconsistent with the PPS Racial Educational Equity Policy, as historically
      underserved populations of students would be disproportionately adversely affected.
      PPS, they claim, did not seriously consider moving Grant to Jefferson rather
      than Marshall. This option would have reduced the impact of the transition on
      disadvantaged students in the Grant attendance area, which tend to live farther
      from Marshall and have the fewest options for getting to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n
      \                                                                                                       \tFor
      Franklin, however, <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8g4MqH4-OKV0VwOHZ0b29qOUE/view?usp=sharing'>PPS
      and U.S. Census data</a> show that many of the school's economically disadvantaged
      and underserved students live closer to Marshall than to Franklin, so the move
      is not likely to raise equity concerns. The close proximity of Marshall and
      Franklin also makes the move a less drastic change for most Franklin students.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      prepares to make the big move to Marshall for the next two school years, PPS
      has been making improvements to the campus that will serve as a temporary home
      to Franklin and subsequently Grant. Using money from the same November 2012
      bond measure that is modernizing Franklin, PPS has constructed new sidewalks,
      crosswalks, and LED lighting in the Marshall parking lot. There have also been
      upgrades to the school building, including replacement of the fire alarm system
      ($1.35 million), interior painting, carpet and flooring replacement, and other
      various upgrades. Most of the upgrades to the Marshall Campus were completed
      in November, at an estimated total cost of $3.57 million.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tA
      new turf athletic field was also installed over the summer as part of the PPS
      Great Fields program. This $1.9 million project was not financed by the construction
      bond, but instead from a combination of Oregon School Construction Excise Tax
      revenues, a Nike sponsorship, and private university contributions.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      combined with the other improvements, this makes a total of about $5.5 million
      of recent improvements to Marshall. It is nowhere near the magnitude of Franklin's
      $82 million modernization, but some think it is a large sum considering that
      Marshall will only serve as a \"swing-site\" for four years, with no subsequent
      plans for the campus at present.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tTorrien
      Bruce (10) said that he dislikes the Marshall campus, and that it \"seems like
      a waste of money. For four years, I am sure the kids would be fine with the
      building not being that good, and then Franklin would be better when we got
      back.\" Others think it is worth the money to make minor improvements to Marshall.\n</p>\n<p>\n

      think that it is a good long term investment, because they are only using it
      for four years now, but they could use it again the future,\" said Daniel Frentress
      (11). \"There are still going to be students there for four years, so it is
      still important that it is nice and good enough to use.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tThe
      new sidewalks at Marshall provide a safer route to the school building from
      the edge of the campus, which unlike Franklin is dominated by car parking and
      drop-off areas.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                        \t{{

      there is no dedicated space for pedestrians on the block between 92nd Avenue
      and the campus, but PPS is negotiating with the Portland Bureau of Transportation
      to create a safer environment on this street. There will be no additional yellow
      bus service to transport students to the campus, so many students will rely
      on walking, biking, or TriMet to get to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tIn
      November, Grant Magazine (Grant High School's student publication) {{link (published
      an article) [http://grantmagazine.com/marshall/] }} detailing concerns with
      their school's temporary move to Marshall in September 2017. Reporters found
      that moving Grant to the Marshall Campus was inconsistent with the PPS Racial
      Educational Equity Policy, as historically underserved populations of students
      would be disproportionately adversely affected. PPS, they claim, did not seriously
      consider moving Grant to Jefferson rather than Marshall. This option would have
      reduced the impact of the transition on disadvantaged students in the Grant
      attendance area, which tend to live farther from Marshall and have the fewest
      options for getting to school.\n</p>\n<p>\n                                                                                                        \tFor
      Franklin, however, {{ link (PPS and U.S. Census data) [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8g4MqH4-OKV0VwOHZ0b29qOUE/view?usp=sharing]
      }} show that many of the school's economically disadvantaged and underserved
      students live closer to Marshall than to Franklin, so the move is not likely
      to raise equity concerns. The close proximity of Marshall and Franklin also
      makes the move a less drastic change for most Franklin students.\n</p>\n<p>\n

    - What is the Solar Impulse?
    - "<p>\n\tSolar Impulse is a group based in Switzerland that wants to showcase
      their plane to the world. The group's goal is to deliver a \"First Round-The-World
      Solar Flight\" in 2015, following their 12 years of research on making the plane
      a reality.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1999, Solar Impulse began research into an aircraft
      that could run on solar energy. After 10 years, that aircraft was unveiled,
      Solar Impulse 1 Prototype HB-SIA. The plane has a wingspan of 208 ft. It has
      very minimal weight compared to the average weight of a car, weighing about
      3,527 pounds. The horsepower of the plane is about 1000 watts. In 2010, the
      aircraft went into professional flight tests to examine the plane's flight envelope,
      and did night flights to guarantee, it can function at night. During the flight,
      three world records were established specifically for Solar Impulse 1. Maximum
      altitude (9,235 meters), maximum duration (26h10m19s) and gain in altitude (8,744
      meters). By September in 2010, Solar Impulse's prototype landed at the international
      airports of Geneva and Zurich. Solar Impulse has established challenges for
      the Solar Impulse aircrafts. For flight training, they plan on making a flight
      simulator for the aircraft. This will give pilots the opportunity to train for
      long duration missions and practice the delicate handling of their aircraft.
      They are also developing a monitoring system for the plane, that constantly
      checks the functioning of an autopilot system and provides detection of safety
      limits. As for staff in Solar Impulse, partial leadership was handed to a man
      named Andre Borschberg. Andre Borschberg is the co-founder of Solar Impulse.
      He is also the man who did many flight tests for Solar Impulse planes and was
      responsible for completing a 24-hour flight for Solar Impulse Prototypes. Bertrand
      Piccard is a Swiss psychiatrist and balloonist. He is a pilot and the chairman
      of Solar Impulse who is currently working with others on the Mission Control
      Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSolar Impulse 2 will be participating in Solar Impulse's
      First Round-The-World flight. It will take-off from Abu Dhabi, capital of the
      United Arab Emirate, in late February or early March. The plane will return
      to it's starting location in late July or early August. Currently Solar Impulse
      is focusing on their Mission Control Center. After that Solar Impulse will focus
      on the Round-The-World flight.\n</p>"

    - The Raven Boys Review
    - '"A wild and extremely distressing journey"'
    - "<p>\n\tUpon reading the summary of <em>The Raven Boys</em> by Maggie Stiefvater,
      your first thought will be: \"Oh god, another Young Adult book where a girl's
      entire life hinges around a boy. I'm already bored.\" But hold on, dear reader,
      because the back of this book is an utter lie. The misleading and vaguely yawn-worthy
      synopsis of <em>The Raven Boys</em> barely scratches the surface of this wild
      and extremely distressing journey.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, here's the breakdown: At
      its most basic level, this book is about one girl and four boys and their beautiful,
      wonderful, heartbreaking friendship. It is also about magic, clairvoyant women,
      trees that speak Latin, and a dead Welsh king named Glendower.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe
      story begins with one girl: Blue Sargent. Blue Sargent has grown up in a house
      literally filled to the brim with women psychics, and ever since she was little,
      these psychics have all agreed upon one thing: if Blue is to kiss her true love,
      he will die.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis burden of knowledge has never raised any problems
      for Blue until, one chilly and genre-appropriately spooky night, our heroine
      sees her first spirit-- a boy who is going to be dead within the next twelve
      months. This soon-to-be-dead spirit wears the uniform of a local boys' private
      academy, and his only communication with Blue is his name: Gansey. The only
      reason Blue would see a spirit on that particular night is if he's her true
      love, or if she killed him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe plot thickens and goes ever onward
      from there. Blue becomes somehow entangled in a feverish search for Glendower,
      a long dead king, along with four boys who attend the rich private school: Gansey,
      who is unaware of his imminent demise; Ronan, who prefers punching to speaking;
      Adam, who attends his expensive school with a scholarship, three jobs, and impeccable
      grades; and Noah, who is quiet and mysterious.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, dear reader,
      the synopsis of <em>The Raven Boys</em> was misleading in one very important
      way: Blue was not a girl who was incomplete without a boy. These four boys were
      incomplete without her. She is the final piece to their puzzle; she is the one
      who begins the story. Well-written, hilarious, poignant, and, at times, absolutely
      breathtaking, <em>The Raven Boys</em> is one of the finest books that has come
      out in the past several years.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you would like to dip your toe
      into this series, you can grab <em>The Raven Boys</em>, <em>The Dream Thieves</em>,
      and <em>Blue Lily, Lily Blue</em> for your reading pleasure right now. The fourth
      and final book, <em>The Raven King</em>, is out in September.\n</p>"

    - The Raven Boys is a novel far more interesting then most assume, with magic,
      clairvoyant woman and Latin speaking trees, read more to find out if this is
      the book for you.

    - Billionaire Announces plan for Global Internet
    - Could the internet reach Mars too?
    - "<p>\n\tWhen you look back at the history of the internet so far, some events
      jump out. The switch from broadband to fiber optics, the use of Wi-Fi, the emergence
      of huge companies like Google. If billionaire Elon Musk has anything to say
      about it, we may be able to add interplanetary internet to the list.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMusk
      originally made his fortune through the internet, inventing and then later selling
      services such as PayPal to accumulate wealth which he later put into building
      companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. He's hoping to dream even bigger now, announcing
      on January 16 that he wants to spend at least ten billion dollars to launch
      hundreds of satellites into space to spread high speed internet throughout the
      planet and beyond.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis isn't the first news of Musk's interest
      in cheap internet for the masses via satellite, as he discussed in mid-November
      of last year, when he hinted at the company's plan in a tweet. At first many
      laughed the plan off as just another crazy idea for the spreading of the internet,
      yet Musk once again brought it up on January 16. This time the announcement
      was in a formal setting, during an event in Seattle for SpaceX.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMusk
      stated that he wants to bring the internet to areas with few people for as low
      of a cost as possible. One of the best parts of using satellites for internet
      according to Musk is not having to worry about wires. \"The speed of light is
      40 percent faster in the vacuum of space than it is for fiber. The long-term
      potential is to be the primary means of long-distance Internet traffic and to
      serve people in sparsely populated areas,\" said Musk.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAny plan
      by Musk just wouldn't seem right unless there was a distant goal, and that's
      where Mars comes in. \"It will be important for Mars to have a global communications
      network as well,\" Musk said during the event. \"I think this needs to be done,
      and I don't see anyone else doing it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe project is expected
      to cost anywhere from ten to fifteen billion dollars and could end up employing
      more than 1000 people. To begin with though, Musk has assigned 60 people to
      work on the project which currently has not been named. He expects the project
      to take at least 12 to 15 years to spread the network across the planet, although
      it will likely take much longer for internet to reach Mars due to the nature
      of the project.\n</p>"

      extremely generous with toppings. Not only that, but the bread roll used was
      huge, and ended up being enough for two meals- well worth the $6.50. A friend

    - "<p>\n        \tAn instinctive feeling of panic ties my nerves into knots. My
      surroundings are strange... old cobblestone streets in a surprisingly well-lit
      alleyway; earth-tone houses with high open windows and no doors or spaces between
      them, a continuous wall with no one behind it. No clouds in the vivid sky, so
      open in contrast to my imprisonment. The alley curves and I notice I'm running,
      my bare feet smacking the stones in 4/4 time is the only sound. Then I stop.
      The walls have turned to stone like the street, but there is now a break in
      the wall: an inviting archway with sunlight pouring out in a shifting yellowish
      reflection. I creep up to the entryway, curious but suspicious. There are four
      rough, salt-colored stone steps immediately downward before they disappear into
      the most beautiful body of water to ever exist. <em>It must be for goddesses</em>,
      I think, because nothing this remarkable could ever be here for an earthly creature.
      And yet it feels necessary for me to delve in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThis pool is not large, no bigger than the average bedroom. There
      are no windows looking in, and delicate vines, mosses, succulents, and flowers
      cling to the stone walls. A warm wind blows ripples across its surface and I
      inhale the scent of oceans and fresh bread and cherry blossoms. The azure water,
      while appearingly transparent, cannot be seen through, as I've stepped down
      to the water's edge at some point and my feet are lost below. Somehow I'm aware
      that this oasis is very deep, very salty, and very good, <em>oh such a good,
      perfect place to be, that I think I should float for some time…</em> In the
      depths of my mind I remember that the Dead Sea's salt content is high enough
      that a person can lay back effortlessly and be caressed by the water. I take
      a few more faithful steps down, again mysteriously knowing stairs will be where
      my feet go, until I'm up to my knees in the warm… <em>sea. This must be some
      kind of sea…</em> The hem of my ivory sundress with its delicate blue embroidery
      drifts along the top of the water as I turn around. I begin to lay back, and
      am met by the sweet kisses of each water particle as I reach them. I close my
      eyes in content love for this place, myself, the empty sky above, for the little
      pink flowers and bees, and not another soul exists in this world.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tI'm seeing myself now, from above, and I am something
      out of a dream. My dress and hair are splayed out like rays of sunshine in that
      soft, motherly water. The body I'm seeing myself from is drifting, further away
      from the physical form, so appeased with her closed eyes and blossoming mind.
      I am gone.\n        </p>"
    - "<p>\n        \tAn instinctive feeling of panic ties my nerves into knots. My
      surroundings are strange... old cobblestone streets in a surprisingly well-lit
      alleyway; earth-tone houses with high open windows and no doors or spaces between
      them, a continuous wall with no one behind it. No clouds in the vivid sky, so
      open in contrast to my imprisonment. The alley curves and I notice I'm running,
      my bare feet smacking the stones in 4/4 time is the only sound. Then I stop.
      The walls have turned to stone like the street, but there is now a break in
      the wall: an inviting archway with sunlight pouring out in a shifting yellowish
      reflection. I creep up to the entryway, curious but suspicious. There are four
      rough, salt-colored stone steps immediately downward before they disappear into
      the most beautiful body of water to ever exist. <em>It must be for goddesses</em>,
      I think, because nothing this remarkable could ever be here for an earthly creature.
      And yet it feels necessary for me to delve in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThis pool is not large, no bigger than the average bedroom. There
      are no windows looking in, and delicate vines, mosses, succulents, and flowers
      cling to the stone walls. A warm wind blows ripples across its surface and I
      inhale the scent of oceans and fresh bread and cherry blossoms. The azure water,
      while appearingly transparent, cannot be seen through, as I've stepped down
      to the water's edge at some point and my feet are lost below. Somehow I'm aware
      that this oasis is very deep, very salty, and very good, <em>oh such a good,
      perfect place to be, that I think I should float for some time…</em> In the
      depths of my mind I remember that the Dead Sea's salt content is high enough
      that a person can lay back effortlessly and be caressed by the water. I take
      a few more faithful steps down, again mysteriously knowing stairs will be where
      my feet go, until I'm up to my knees in the warm… <em>sea. This must be some
      kind of sea…</em> The hem of my ivory sundress with its delicate blue embroidery
      drifts along the top of the water as I turn around. I begin to lay back, and
      am met by the sweet kisses of each water particle as I reach them. I close my
      eyes in content love for this place, myself, the empty sky above, for the little
      pink flowers and bees, and not another soul exists in this world.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tI'm seeing myself now, from above, and I am something
      out of a dream. My dress and hair are splayed out like rays of sunshine in that
      soft, motherly water. The body I'm seeing myself from is drifting, further away

      I am gone.\n        </p>"

    - ''
    - "<p>\n\tAre you a fantasy fan, or just looking for something new? You might
      enjoy Robin McKinley's <em>Shadows</em>, which follows 17 year old Maggie, who
      lives in a world which is divided into three main regions: Oldworld, Newworld
      and Farworld, corresponding to Europe, North America and Asia.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t
      Magic is outlawed in both Newworld and Farworld; the government has focused
      on science, and the magic gene no longer exists within the populous. Magic is
      still born in the people of Oldworld, which practices magic. Maggie has nothing
      to do with magic until her mom marries Val, a stranger from Oldworld. Maggie
      notices strange behavior in Val and observes that it's \"like there [is] more
      than just Val there…I noticed there was something wrong with the darkness… It
      was the shadows…\" (7).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <em>Shadows</em>, McKinley creates
      an interesting niche in the fantasy genre by blending sci-fi, magic and dystopia.
      Newworld is an authoritarian society where the government will persecute you
      just for using \"a charm to cure warts or make hair grow\" (13). Sci-fi is incorporated
      by McKinley's invention of industries like NIDL- a government agency that deals
      with magical events or her invention of a scientific procedure- the removal
      of the magic gene. It is also shown by her invention of technology- armydar
      is radar run by the army that prevents magical events. In the book, sci-fi and
      dystopia blend together to create a believable society, while magic acts as
      the catalyst for adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother reason that this book is worth
      a read are the interactions between Maggie and Val. Over the course of the book,
      their relationship evolves from one of deep hatred to one of respect and understanding.
      At first, Maggie hates Val because of the many eerie shadows that follow him
      around. She is terrified that he is secretly an evil magician, come to destroy
      her family. However, as she gradually gets to know him better, and after Val
      saves one of her friends, he gains Maggie's respect. The best thing about the
      change is that it is gradual, and feels realistic. If you want to read a book
      with a blend of sci-fi, dystopia and fiction, and that has good character relationships,
      then <em>Shadows </em>is for you.\n</p>"

    - "<p>\n                                \tLast year, fans of the Trailblazers
      bore witness to one of the most successful seasons in recent history for the
      team. You probably heard about it: one of the best starts in team history and
      multiple All-Stars, finally culminated in Damian Lillard's now-famous shot to
      win Portland's first playoff series in ages. One aspect often overlooked was
      just how healthy the team was.<strongr></strongr>\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                                \tThis
      season, it hasn't been nearly as easy for the team to stay healthy, and the
      trainers have had no shortage of work. When the injuries started, they just
      kept coming.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tOne of the key contributes
      to Blazers' success in recent seasons has been small forward Nicolas Batum.
      Batum came into this season following a rocky divorce and his problems didn't
      stop there. It was just a few weeks into the season, on a November 9 game against
      the Denver Nuggets, when Batum fell and bruised his knee. He wasn't out for
      long, but Batum suffered an injury to his wrist just a month later, against
      Milwaukee. The injury was simply labeled as wrist soreness, and Batum gritted
      his teeth and played through it. He announced a month later that he had actually
      torn a ligament in his wrist but continued to play, refusing to shut himself
      down to recuperate. Overall, Batum's injuries have resulted in a drop of production
      for a player that had seemed to be an emerging star in the NBA.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                                \tOne
      of the other starters for Portland, All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldridge
      has not been the epitome of health either. Arguably the most important player
      on the team, Aldridge missed a few games early in the season due to a chest
      cold. Then on January 19, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Aldridge injured
      his left thumb while attempting to block a shot by DeMarcus Cousins. After sitting
      out for a pair of games, it was announced that Aldridge would forego surgery
      on his thumb indefinitely, a decision that will shape the Blazers' fortunes
      for the rest of the season.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n
      \                                               \tAnother frontcourt player
      for the Blazers, Robin Lopez, has missed 26 games this year after not missing
      a single game for the previous two seasons. Lopez, like Batum and Aldridge,
      was a major factor in the team's success last year, but after breaking his right
      hand on December 16 the six year center out of Stanford missed a lengthy stretch
      of games. Between Lopez's injury and backup center Joel Freeland's shoulder
      sprain on January 5, the team was lacking in the height department for over
      a month. Lopez eventually returned on February 3, but Freeland isn't expected
      to return until late into February.\n                                </p>\n
      \                               <p>\n                                                \tBlazer
      fans are more than aware of the danger that injuries pose to the team, especially
      in a season in which the Western conference is as competitive as it is. Fan
      Emmett Allen (10) understands the importance of a healthy roster. \"The Blazers
      started out really strong, but it's difficult to keep up that kind of production
      with so many injuries to key players,\" said Allen. \"It's going to be exciting
      to see what they can do with Lopez back as long as everyone else stays healthy.\"
      As many coaches will tell you, the season's not over until the final game is
      played, and with just over half the season gone there is still quite a bit of
      time for the Blazers' fortunes to get better, or much worse.\n                                </p>"

    - Preparation Begins For Women's World Cup 2015

    - "<p>\n        \tWalking out into the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, hearing
      the roar of 90,000 people, and winning the game in a penalty kick shootout is
      arguably one of the most defining and dramatic moments in the USA's soccer history.
      This was at the 1999 Women's World Cup, which was the last time the United States
      won.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tThe USA came close to winning again
      at the last World Cup in 2011. The US team lost to Japan in the final, and they
      want revenge. The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup will take place from June 6 to
      July 5 in Canada, with the opening game in Edmonton. Qualifications have finished
      and the groups have been selected as the opening game draws near.\n        </p>\n
      \       <p>\n        \tIn a lottery last year on December 6 competition groups
      consisting of four teams that will make up the USA's first three games were
      selected. A good or bad group can change a team's progression in the tournament.
      Last world cup, the USA men's national team were placed in the group dubbed
      the \"Group of Death\" because it was so difficult. The women feel like they
      are going have it just is hard this year because they have three teams in the
      top ten FIFA rankings, including Sweden, who they lost to 2-1 in group stages
      last World Cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \t\"It's a good group to
      get us ready to play,\" Jill Ellis, U.S.A Women's coach, said to ussoccer.com.
      \"Physically it's a demanding group, but we've got a lot of depth on our roster
      and we'll be able to manage against some good teams with some good challenges.
      It's probably the toughest group. That's historically been the path the USA
      has taken, and we're obviously going to embrace it.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tEven though their group is challenging, the US must step up in order
      to call themselves the best team in the world. They will also have to deal with
      FIFA's refusal to put down real grass at the world cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tAdditionally, a lawsuit that was filed last fall against FIFA with
      the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario was just dropped as of January 21. Some
      of the best players in the world including Brazil's Marta and the USA's Alex
      Morgan and Abby Wambach were furious that FIFA refused to put down actual grass
      for the women's World Cup, opting for artificial turf for all of the stadiums.
      The players felt that turf has a completely different playing style and it leaves
      them more prone to injury. Some players have viewed this as gender discrimination
      and claim that the men's World Cup would never be played on turf as many players
      would refuse to participate.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \tOn January
      22, Wambach released a statement saying, \"I am hopeful that the players' willingness
      to contest the unequal playing fields — and the tremendous public support we
      received during the effort — marks the start of even greater activism to ensure
      fair treatment when it comes to women's sports.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n
      \       \tThis World Cup hasn't been unfolding without controversy, but the

      a loss in the National Championship Game, and their Heisman Trophy winning quarterback
      declaring himself eligible for the upcoming NFL Draft. However, these events
      weren't indicative of what a successful year it was for the Ducks. They finished
      with record of 12-2, and as Pac-12 and Rose Bowl champions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis
      was the first season of the College Football Playoff. In this new system, the
      top four teams compete to make it to the championship game. The Ducks ranked
      number two in the nation heading into the post-season. They defeated Florida
      State in the Rose Bowl, the first round of the playoffs, and were set up to
      play Ohio State in the final. The game started out slow, but soon Ohio started
      to dominate, and there was no way back for the Ducks, who lost 42-20. The Ducks'
      only other loss was to Arizona State early in the season, and since then, they
      were in control of every game. Even after the loss in the championship, Head
      Coach Mark Helfrich was still extraordinarily proud of his team and quarterback,
      Marcus Mariota.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"I think you could certainly argue that this
      was the best, if not certainly one of the top two or three greatest seasons
      in college football history,\" Helfrich said in an official statement. \"And
      then if you add in the person and the legacy that he [Mariota] has from that
      standpoint, there has never been one greater. None.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's always
      hard to lose such a big game, but this loss was even more difficult considering
      they will also lose Mariota, to the NFL next year. They are also losing defensive
      end Arik Armstead who, along with Mariota, is predicted to be a high first-round
      selection. Next season will present a whole new set of challenges. The tricky
      part about college sports is the fact that the roster has a lot of turnover
      because players graduate. There's no guarantee a team will be as good year after
      year.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"I don't care about legacies,\" Mariota said to Oregonlive.com.
      \"That's other people's opinions. My main focus was to be a great teammate.
      That's all I hoped to accomplish.\" Mariota's humble attitude and leadership
      made him one of the most respected players in college football, both by his
      teammates and coaches.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\"It's been an honor to watch Marcus <a

    - Anti-Vaccine Advocates Complicate Measles Prevention
    - ''
    - "<p>\n\tSince last December, there have been a total of 121 cases of measles
      in the United States. The outbreak, traced back to an infected child visiting
      Disneyland, has spread to a total 17 states so far, Oregon included. And while
      this pales in comparison to last year's whopping 644 cases of measles, the Centers
      of Disease Control and Prevention has said that this outbreak is easily on track
      for surpassing its predecessor.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMost of the people diagnosed with
      measles have not received the vaccination. This is due to opposition to vaccinations
      for religious reasons or fear of dangerous side-effects. These concerns often
      prevent people from vaccinating themselves or their children. These \"anti-vaxxers\"
      are quick to debate about the harmful effects vaccinations can cause, ranging
      from blood poisoning to developing autism. The problem with this argument, however,
      is that these correlations have been proven false numerous times, all by sources
      such as the Institute of Medicine. Despite these claims being debunked, this
      is still a common defense for those against vaccinations.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA defense
      for anti-vaxxers is that, besides the fact the chemicals in vaccinations are
      \"dangerous\", it is healthy to expose children to viruses in order to boost
      their immune system naturally. They argue that since viruses appear naturally
      and vaccines are man-made, it would be better for a child to contract the virus
      and suffer through the disease. These people, especially the parents at the
      heart of the anti-vaccine movement, are being blamed as spreaders and incubators
      of diseases that are entirely preventable.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the New
      York Times, one anti-vax mother simply said that there was \"absolutely no reason
      to get the shot.\" When her 16-year-old daughter was sent home for two weeks
      due to being unvaccinated and vulnerable to measles, she requested to get the
      required shots. Her mother replied with, \"I'd rather you miss an entire semester
      than you get the shot.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnti-vaxxers aren't the only ones being
      called negligent; the argument is going both sides. In an interview with The
      Washington Post, Doctor Jack Wolfson, a cardiologist who is very vocal against
      vaccines, said, \"You didn't ask once about those vaccines. You didn't ask about
      the chemicals in them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe scrutiny from both sides about the
      safety of human life has always existed, but one thing is for certain; exactly
      what is deemed as \"healthy\" when it comes to disease prevention is entirely
      up to opinion.\n</p>"

    - "<p>\n        \tSince last December, there have been a total of 121 cases of
      measles in the United States. The outbreak, traced back to an infected child
      visiting Disneyland, has spread to a total 17 states so far, Oregon included.
      And while this pales in comparison to last year's whopping 644 cases of measles,
      the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has said that this outbreak is

      \       \tMost of the people diagnosed with measles have not received the vaccination.
      This is due to opposition to vaccinations for religious reasons or fear of dangerous
      side-effects. These concerns often prevent people from vaccinating themselves
      or their children. These \"anti-vaxxers\" are quick to debate about the harmful
      effects vaccinations can cause, ranging from blood poisoning to developing autism.
      The problem with this argument, however, is that these correlations have been
      proven false numerous times, all by sources such as the Institute of Medicine.

      the week of February 9, Franklin High School clubs including German Club, Russian
      Club, Vietnamese Club, and many more shared details, information, and activities
      related to their culture. For example, the Black Student Union (BSU) communicated
      facts about Africa. Domingo Urrutia also shared his feelings about of what multicultural
      means to him. He said, \"it's a chance to celebrate all our cultures within

      would like to see more than just the preview assembly that took place on February
      5, you can go see the full show of each performance that represents FHS student
      and staff cultures, on February 13 in the Auditorium between 6:30-8pm. You can
      expect to see the Black Student Union doing an extended version of the Black
      Student Union step, a Vietnamese dance from the Vietnamese club, a Pacific Island
      dance from Islander club, a Chinese song performance, and much more during the
      show.\n</p>"
