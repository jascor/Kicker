          %h1 Dario Raschio: Homegrown Portlander, WWII Veteran, Retired FHS Teacher
        .featureBody.clear
          %p The house on the Willamette riverfront in which retired Franklin science teacher Dario Raschio was born has been demolished for years, but Saint Michael's Parish still stands just a quarter mile west, surrounded by the tall gray buildings that now make up downtown Portland. This is where Raschio was baptized, had his First Communion, and where his children and grandchildren have been baptized as well.
          %p Raschio celebrated his 100th birthday on November 10, his church outdating him by about 20 years, having been founded in 1894 by Italian Catholic immigrants. Portland's 'Little Italy' neighborhood, where Raschio grew up. has since been developed almost to the point of being unrecognizable, but Saint Michael the Archangel Catholic Parish serves as a reminder of the area's history.

          %p After attending grade school at St. Michael's, Raschio went to St. Stephen's High School in SE Portland, where he remembers playing baseball against Franklin. After high school, he enrolled in the pharmacy program at North Pacific College, but transferred to OSU a year later, switching into the PreMed program, and ultimately into teaching.
          %p It was difficult to find work in the heart of the Great Depression, and Raschio applied for all kinds of jobs across the state before finally getting a letter granting him an interview for a teaching position in Gold Beach, OR. At the same time, he received a telegram offering him a job as a government clerk in Washington, D.C. The job in Gold Beach would have only paid $85 a month, while the job being handed to him in D.C. paid $100 a month, so Raschio traveled across the country to the capital. Two years later, in September 1941, a gathering was held in D.C. where the names of ten men were drawn for the ceremonial part of the army draft.
          %p "Guess who was one of the ten? Lucky me," Raschio jokes.
          %p He didn't want to be a footsoldier, so he requested a transfer to the navy and was able to start flight training on December 1, 1941. A week later the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, commencing the U.S.'s involvement in World War II, so Raschio went through his training and ended up being sent to Cherry Point Marine Base in North Carolina. There he flew 'dawn patrol' up and down the Atlantic coast hoping to catch submarines when they surfaced.
          %p When Raschio returned to Portland on leave, he found that his soon-to-be wife, Maria, had organized everything for their wedding, and he was married to her during his two week stay before reporting back for his military service.
          %p Eventually Raschio was commissioned to a heavy cruiser in Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed around through the Panama Canal to its homeport of San Francisco. From there the ship became involved in the WWII fight for the Marshall Islands. He risked his life many times while aboard, surviving hurricanes and monsoons that tossed the cruiser in every direction, and flying reconnaissance missions in small planes catapulted off the deck of the ship.
          %p On one of these missions, when flying over an enemy island, Raschio noticed a small track leading away from the airstrip. To get a closer look, he flew down to an altitude of 500 feet, all while evading enemy fire, and saw that the track led to a building that he could only presume must be an ammunition dump, strategically placed away from the airfield to avoid U.S. bombing. Immediately after landing, he reported to the General Quarters of the friendly ship that retrieved him, showing the commander where to fire the ship's guns in an attempt to hit the building.
          %p As stated in the USS Hale historical records, "The highlight of this week, which even now is unsurpassed, was that fuel dump the Hale touched off in one of the night bombardments. Enormous blasts of flame and smoke could be seen for miles out to sea. Never a 4th of July celebration back home was seen as colorful as this."
          %p Raschio responds with a smile, "To that I want to add: 'see Dario for details.'"

          %p In returning home to Portland, Raschio wasted no time in getting the job that he had always sought in Portland's public school system. He was hired as a science teacher at Franklin High School in 1945, and taught for 36 years before retiring in 1980. Though the stories might not be as hair-raising as those of the war, the memories of Franklin are fond.
          %p "Franklin was a nice school. We had a wonderful faculty at that time," Raschio says. "I always thought it was the nicest high school in Portland."
          %p He does recall a year where he was not graced with the most responsible group of students, and the 'crying towel' that he offered those who failed his class got a fair amount of use.
          %p "I couldn't in good faith pass people who only show up once a week, maybe not even that," he explains. So when he flunked the entire class but for one person who earned a D, he simply gave them the crying towel. "I said 'I have done everything I can for you, and this is the best I can do,'" Raschio recalls.
          %p After retiring from teaching, Dario Raschio returned to Saint Michael's Parish as an usher, serving his Italian Catholic community that has preserved with the downtown Portland church as its anchor. His wife passed away in 2010, but he continues to embrace the life with which he has been graced, most recently with the tumult of celebration surrounding his 100th birthday.
